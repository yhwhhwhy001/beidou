# D-041 bridge, 2026-09-18.  IT REMOVES ITSELF BY EXPIRY, NOT BY BEING REMEMBERED.
#
# What happened: rebuilding `.beidou/data/membership.parquet` (2,042 -> 2,056 refreshes,
# union 211 -> 212, last 09-03 -> 09-17) moved a BLOCKING manifest field, so tsmom's cited
# evidence no longer describes the data on disk and `registry_dataset_problems` refuses the
# armed start.  Re-issuing that evidence on the rebuilt table came back FAIL by 0.0106
# (OOS 1.5628 against a 1.5733 threshold, p_family 0.0547), so pointing the registry at the
# new report blocks too, on `evidence verdict FAIL`.  Both pointers block, and the old table
# has no copy anywhere.  Full account: docs/RESEARCH_LOG.md, 2026-09-18.
#
# What this does and does not do: `--allow-unvalidated` bypasses ONLY the startup refusal in
# `live_cmd.py`.  Every `dataset:` and `evidence:` line is still printed to this log, and the
# guards, the kill switch and the risk budget are untouched.  While it is active the armed
# loop runs on a book whose evidence does not clear its own gate - and that sentence is the
# whole reason the line below announces itself on every single start.
#
# Why it expires instead of waiting to be noticed: a flag that needs a human to remember it is
# the failure this repo keeps re-learning.  After the date the flag is simply not passed, the
# strict gate comes back, and an armed start that still cannot qualify FAILS.  That is the
# safe direction - no trading on evidence that does not clear - so if it happens it is not a
# regression, it is this bridge doing the last thing it was built to do.
BRIDGE_UNTIL="2026-10-13"   # the construction freeze ends here; tsmom's evidence is settled in that package

# Exit code 0 (clean stop, e.g. --cycles reached) is not relaunched; any failure is, after ThrottleInterval.
# --armed is what makes a real-order run explicit (DL-L1).  This launcher is the only caller that
# should carry it; a loop started by hand in a worktree has to type it, which is the point.

# `${BRIDGE[@]+"${BRIDGE[@]}"}`, not `"${BRIDGE[@]}"` (2026-09-25).  launchd runs this with /bin/bash,
# which on macOS is 3.2.57, and before bash 4.4 expanding an EMPTY array under `set -u` is an
# "unbound variable" error.  So the day the bridge expired and BRIDGE stayed empty, this line would
# have exited 1 before `beidou` ever ran - the strict evidence gate above would never have been
# reached, and every relaunch would have died the same way.  CI's bash is 5.x and cannot see it:
# tests/cli/test_the_bridge_expiry_survives_the_bash_launchd_runs.py checks the expansion by text.
