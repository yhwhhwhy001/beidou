# DL-G5: soak a CANDIDATE registry beside the armed loop, writing nothing the armed loop reads.
#
# The canary answers one question - would this registry, deployed, behave like a working deployment? -
# and deliberately not whether the candidate has any edge (KILL-AR-04).  Reading it as an alpha filter
# is how a good sleeve gets blocked by a venue hiccup and the block gets recorded against the sleeve.
#
# Three isolations, each of which has to hold on its own:
#   --dry-run     no venue writes, and `--state-dir` refuses to run without it or --paper;
#   --state-dir   a separate state.json, cycles.jsonl and heartbeat, so the armed loop's record is
#                 untouched even if this process crashes mid-write;
#   --registry    a candidate file, so the armed loop's own registry is never opened for writing here.
#
# It does NOT restart, promote or write the real registry.  `beidou governance apply` does that, and
# only while the autonomy switch is on.
