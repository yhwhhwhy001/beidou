"""Q4b: does Li & Ji's N_eff give this family's gate its declared false-positive rate?

Pre-registered in docs/RESEARCH_LOG.md before this ran (2026-09-14, section "Q4b 预登记").  It answers
one question and nothing else:

    The gate is `max_sharpe_quantile(n, var, alpha) = sqrt(var) * Phi^-1((1-alpha)^(1/n))` - the
    1-alpha quantile of the maximum of n INDEPENDENT N(0, var) draws.  Under this family's REAL
    correlation structure, does the threshold computed at n = N_eff actually reject 5% of the time?

Three things worth knowing before reading the numbers.

**The variance cancels.**  Every column of the correlation matrix has unit variance, and the threshold
is `sqrt(var) * z`, so `P(max_i sqrt(var) * X_i >= sqrt(var) * z) = P(max_i X_i >= z)`.  The FWER of
this gate is a property of the correlation structure and n alone - it does not depend on the
candidate's sampling variance at all.  So this script never needs `var`, and the answer is the same
for every candidate the family could produce.

**The real matrix, not a same-spectrum surrogate.**  Li & Ji reads only the eigenvalues, so a matrix
built from those eigenvalues on a random orthogonal basis has the same N_eff - and a different
distribution of the maximum, because that reads the eigenvectors too.  Validating against a surrogate
would validate a different family.  This loads the matrix `research mine --measure` persisted.

**The control is the check on the simulation, not a result.**  Correlation can only make the maximum
of n draws smaller, so the threshold at the RAW count must reject at most 5% - if the control comes
out above 5%, the sampler is wrong and nothing below it may be read.

Sampling is done through the eigendecomposition rather than a Cholesky factor: the matrix is built from
676 highly collinear streams and is numerically near-singular, so `cholesky` is not reliable on it.
Eigenvalues are clipped at zero, which is the only place this script rounds anything, and the size of
that clip is reported.
