"""`governance_state.json`: the book's lifecycle state, written the way `stopped_books` is written.

Separate from `lifecycle` on purpose.  Everything in that module is a pure function of the state and
one event, which is what lets the same code decide live and replay history; the moment it also knew
how to load itself, the replay would be reading whatever is on disk today rather than the state it was
handed.  So the state machine decides and this module remembers, and the two are testable apart.

The format is a plain dict of primitives with a `version`.  It is not a pickle and not a dataclass
dump: this file has to be readable by a person during an incident, and by a future version of this
code that has since added a field.  An unknown field is dropped rather than refused, and a missing one
takes the dataclass default - the same compatibility rule `TrialRecord.from_json` follows, and for the
same reason: a record that cannot read its own history is not a record.

    """Rebuild a book, refusing nothing that a person could plausibly have hand-edited into it.

    An unreadable state is an empty book rather than an exception, the same direction the live loop's
    own state store takes.

    This used to claim that was SAFE, because "an empty book has no probes, so every rule that could
    act on it refuses for want of a candidate".  That is true only of the candidate being evaluated,
    which the caller supplies.  Every rule that reads the book for CONSTRAINTS reads an empty one as
    headroom: `len(book.probes)` is 0 against R3's two slots and `probe_fraction` is 0.0 against the
    1/3 cap.  Measured 2026-09-09 with no state file on the trading machine - a second 1/3 probe was
    ALLOWED on top of the flow probe already running live, 2/3 of the book against a 1/3 cap.

    So an empty book is permissive, not conservative, and the sleeves that are actually running have
    to be IN it: see `governance/governance_state.json` and the test that holds it to KILL-AR-06.
    Falling back to empty is still the right behaviour for a TORN file - deciding on half a book is
    worse - but it is a fallback with teeth, not a safe default.
