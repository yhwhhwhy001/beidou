"""Construction changes waiting for a batch window, with a reader.  Same shape as `reopen.py`, same reason.

§8's Phase 4a is "块 4 必改项**一次改完** → 重启 → 攒 30 天干净窗口" - a plan that presumes a LIST of
construction changes applied together in one window.  That list never existed.  Each change was
decided in a log entry, and the log has no reader, so on the day a window opens nobody is told what it
was supposed to carry.  The 2026-09-10 audit found the same shape in thirteen reopen conditions; this
is it in the other direction - not a closed hypothesis nobody reopens, but an open decision nobody
applies.

The concrete cost, measured 2026-09-12: the probe stop's caliber was ruled, recalibrated, and all four
of its falsifiers passed - and it cannot ship, because `max_loss` is inside `construction_fingerprint`
and changing it clears M-010's window.  So it waits for 2026-10-03.  Without this file, the record of
"what to apply, with which measured values, and why it waited" would be one log entry among thirty.

**This module applies nothing.**  A batch window is an operator running `governance apply` through a
transaction; a command that could apply its own queue on a date is exactly the shape R10 forbids.  What
a machine can answer here is only whether the date has arrived - everything else (is the change still
right? has the measurement gone stale? is this the window to spend?) is a judgement, and the entries
say so.
