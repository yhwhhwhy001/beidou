"""Where `scheduler.Context` comes from, field by field, with "I could not read this" as an answer.

`scheduler.next_action` is a pure function of a `Context` and it had no assembler, which is why
`scheduler` and `budget` were both sitting in the reachability guard's EXEMPT list: 227 lines of R1
and DL-G8 that no command could run.  This module is the missing half.

The whole difficulty is in the fields that cannot be read.  Every one of them is a COUNT whose branch
in the scheduler is `> 0`, so an unreadable field defaulted to 0 does not produce an error - it
produces a confident answer, one step further down the pipeline than the evidence supports.  That is
the same defect as an empty `governance_state.json` reading as headroom, and it is the reason this
module returns `Field`s rather than a bare `Context`: the value the scheduler is handed, and the
sentence saying where it came from, travel together.

An unknown field is placed at its conservative value (0 for a count, "unchanged" for the space
digest) AND named.  `load_bearing` then asks the only question that matters about it: with the same
context and this one field moved to its other reading, does the scheduler still say the same thing?
The scheduler's branches are four `> 0` tests and one equality, so "the other reading" is a finite
set and the question has an exact answer rather than a heuristic one.  A field that could not change
the answer is reported and ignored; a field that could turns the answer into WAIT, carrying the
reason - which is what `scheduler`'s own docstring promises WAIT always does.

    produced, a further round cannot produce an admissible candidate - it can only raise the bar.  On

    as the bucket count, while `dsr_inputs` builds N as `ledger_trials + grid + declared prior`.  For
