"""R6 / DL-G4: writing the registry as a transaction that can be taken back.

KILL-Q15 is the reason this exists.  The engine builds its model once at startup, so editing
`alpha_registry.yaml` under a running loop changes nothing until a restart - and in 2026-09 that gap
ran for 96 cycles with the loop trading one registry while the file described another.  Q9 (operator
ruling, 2026-09-08) is that the machine performs this write from the first transaction, with no human
confirmation point; what stands in for the person is this module's ability to undo itself.

**One deliberate departure from the plan's ordering, and the reason.**  §2 describes: write the YAML,
request a restart, let the startup gate refuse, then roll back.  This checks the gate IN PROCESS,
before any restart is requested, so a bad write never reaches a running loop at all.  That is only
safe because it is the SAME function startup calls - the gate is injected by the caller and the caller
passes `beidou_live.config.registry_evidence_problems`.  A second, similar check written here would be
the divergence this whole project keeps finding, so there isn't one; DRILL-G1 exists to prove the
injected gate is the real one by feeding it a report whose sha256 does not match.

Nothing here restarts anything.  A transaction reports `restart_required`, and who acts on that is a
question about deployment, not about the registry.
