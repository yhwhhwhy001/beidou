"""The gate between `governance apply` and the registry: R3/R4/R5/R7 and K-EX14, asked before the write.

Found by the 2026-09-09 audit, and it is the largest instance of this repository's recurring defect:
a rule written down, versioned, hashed into `policy_digest()`, printed by `governance status` - and
consulted by nothing on the path that actually changes the book.

`governance apply` asked exactly two questions before writing: is the autonomy switch on, and does the
startup gate accept the result.  That gate (`registry_evidence_problems`) verifies evidence pointers,
their sha256 and the construction they were produced under.  It does not count probe slots, does not
sum fractions, does not know the book is frozen, and has never heard of a lifetime entry limit.  So
every constraint §3 lists as a precondition of `queued -> probe` was decorative on the one code path
that promotes.  Measured: raising `books.flow_short.fraction` from 0.333 to 0.9 in the proposed YAML
was accepted, 0.9 of the book to an unproven sleeve against a cap of 1/3, and the transaction log
recorded it as a clean APPLY by actor `machine`.

Two layers, because they fail differently:

* **the registry check** is a statement about the FILE - probe slots and the budget share, computed
  from the proposed bytes with no reference to any state.  It holds even when `governance_state.json`
  is missing or wrong, which matters because `state.load` reads an absent file as an EMPTY book and an
  empty book is headroom, not safety (that docstring records the same measurement).
* **the lifecycle check** is a statement about the TRANSITION, and it needs the state.  It runs per
  candidate whose exposure grows, and it is the only place R4/R5/R7 and K-EX14 can be asked.

Facts this module cannot measure are False, never defaulted True, and the refusal says which fact was
missing rather than which rule failed.  "Could not be computed" is not "passed" - the same rule the
drawdown ladder follows when no attribution row lands on a cycle.
