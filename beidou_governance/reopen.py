"""The reopen conditions, with a reader.  Until 2026-09-10 they had thirteen authors and none.

The 2026-09-09 audit found `REFUTED` written 69 times in `RESEARCH_LOG.md` and thirteen blocks headed
「重开条件」 - carefully worded, each naming what would have to become true for a closed hypothesis to
be looked at again.  A full-tree grep for `REFUTED` and `reopen` across `beidou_governance/` and
`governance_cmd.py` returned nothing.  Nothing read them, nothing tracked them, and nothing would ever
say that one had come true.

So the mechanism was a convention.  The concrete cost, measured the same day: carry's condition is
"块 1 的数据宽度", and `data spot`, `data index`, `data onchain` and `data macro` all landed between
2026-09-09 and 2026-09-10.  Whether that IS the width carry meant is a judgement - but nothing had
told anybody there was a judgement to make.  A hypothesis stays closed by neglect rather than by
evidence, which is the same failure as a control that does not control, pointed the other way.

**What this module refuses to do.**  Nine of the thirteen conditions cannot be asked of a machine:
they need a named ruling, a decision to pay for a data source, or a piece of research nobody has done.
Those are `operator`, and they are reported as `NEEDS A PERSON` - never as met, never as unmet, and
always counted, because a summary that read "0 met" over a list that is two-thirds unaskable would be
this file committing the very defect it exists to fix.  Turning a judgement into a predicate that
happens to be checkable is how a gate becomes decoration.

The conditions are quoted verbatim from the log.  Paraphrasing one would be loosening or tightening it
on the operator's behalf.
