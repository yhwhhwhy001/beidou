"""DL-G6′: the time rule's events, derived from the live record rather than asserted by hand.

`lifecycle.py` already decides what `WINDOW_SURVIVED` and `PNL_STOP` mean.  Nothing produced them.
The state machine was therefore complete and unreachable: a probe could not reach main, and a main
sleeve could not be sent back, because the only way to move either was for a person to type the event
-- which is exactly the hand-driven promotion §3 exists to remove.

This module is the missing half and nothing more.  It reads `cycles.jsonl`, which is append-only and
carries per cycle the three things the rule needs -- `at`, each probe's `stop`, and `external_flows`
-- and returns the ordered events that record implies.  It decides nothing, writes nothing, and asks
the venue nothing; `evaluate`/`apply` still hold every rule.

**Why it lives here and not in `scheduler.py`.**  The scheduler must never touch `.beidou/live` (its
own docstring says so, and the reason is that a research run's timing would otherwise become a
function of what the book happens to be doing).  The time rule is the opposite: it is a statement
ABOUT the live record.  So it runs on the trading machine, beside the transaction that would act on
it, and reaches the research machine the way everything else does -- through the ledger and the repo.

**The TRANSFER exclusion (T-G6′-3), and why skipping is safe.**  This account is a demo account whose
resets show up as TRANSFER income rows with no fills; equity jumps and the attributed window shows a
loss nobody traded.  A stop reported on such a cycle is not evidence the sleeve lost money, so it is
recorded as skipped, with the reason, instead of counted.

Skipping cannot lose a real stop.  `probe_status` recomputes a TRAILING window every cycle, so a stop
that is real is still true on the next uncontaminated cycle and is counted there.  The exclusion
therefore delays a genuine stop by at most the flow's own cycles, and refuses a spurious one
outright.  That asymmetry is the whole reason it is a skip list rather than a filter: what was
refused, and why, stays readable.
