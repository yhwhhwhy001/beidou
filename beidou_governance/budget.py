"""R1: how many trials a window may buy, read off the ledger rather than remembered.

R3, R4, R5 and R7 are properties of the book's state and live in `lifecycle`.  R1 is not: it is a
property of the trials ledger, which is append-only, shared between sessions, and the only record that
can say what a window actually cost.  Keeping it here rather than in `lifecycle` is what stops the
state machine from holding a counter that a parallel session's `research validate` has already made
wrong - the 2026-09-08 incident was exactly that shape, a search charging 514 rows with nothing on the
terminal saying so.

The count is of DISTINCT trials, folded the way `unique_trials` folds them, because that is what the
DSR denominator reads.  Counting raw lines would charge a replay twice and make the budget stricter
than the thing it is budgeting.
