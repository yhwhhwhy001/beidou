"""R0 recomputed against today's ledger: the `probe -> main` condition §3 named and nothing computed.

§3 gives `probe -> main` three conditions - nine surviving windows, never stopped, and **家族门重算仍过**
- and `probe -> retired` one, which is that same recomputation failing.  The first two were implemented.
The third had no branch in `lifecycle.evaluate` at all, and `Event.FAMILY_GATE_FAILED` had a definition,
a handler, and no producer anywhere in the tree.  Found by the 2026-09-09 audit.

**What "recompute" means, and why it is not a re-run.**  The D-028 gate is `max_sharpe_quantile(N,
variance, alpha)` - the 95th percentile of the best of N draws from a null with the candidate's own
sampling variance.  Everything in it except N is a property of the evidence and does not change after
the report is written.  N is the strategy's ledger bucket, it is append-only, and it grows every time
anybody searches in that family.  So the gate a strategy passed at adoption is not the gate it faces
today, and the recomputation holds the evidence fixed and moves only the denominator.

That is the whole mechanism, and it is worth stating plainly because it cuts both ways: **searching more
retires your own incumbents.**  tsmom was adopted against a threshold of 1.4884 at N=148 and faces
1.5136 at N=183 five days later, on the same 1.8087.  The gate rises as sqrt(2 ln N), so it saturates -
that is why the incumbent survives - but a strategy adopted with a thin margin does not get to keep it
by standing still.

**The scale is taken from the report rather than recomputed.**  `threshold_annual` is the raw quantile
times `sqrt(bars_per_year)`, and the report does not store `bars_per_year`.  Backing the scale out of
the stored pair - threshold / quantile(N_at_adoption) - reproduces the adoption threshold exactly by
construction, which is the point: any difference between then and now is then attributable to N and to
nothing else.  A second implementation of the annualisation would put its own arithmetic into a number
whose whole job is to isolate one variable.

**Absent knowledge is False.**  A strategy whose evidence cannot be read does not pass; it is UNREADABLE,
which is a different operator action from FAIL and is reported as such.
