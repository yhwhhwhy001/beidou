"""DL-G8: what the research loop does next, decided as a pure function of what it can see.

It returns an action; it never performs one.  That split is the whole design: the expensive, stateful
half (enumerate, score, validate) already exists as `beidou_cli.research_cmd`, and wrapping it in a
loop that also decides would produce a scheduler nobody can test without a data archive and an hour.

The order is fixed and it is not a preference.  Mining before checking the budget would charge the
family for a search the budget was going to refuse anyway; checking parity before booking would ask a
question about columns that no book has yet decided to use.  Each step's precondition is the previous
step's output, which is why WAIT is a legitimate answer at every position rather than a failure.

It touches `.beidou/live` never.  The research machine and the trading machine share a git remote and
an append-only ledger; the moment this module reads live state, a research run's timing becomes a
function of what the book happens to be doing.
