"""Drawdown throttle: scale gross exposure down as equity falls from its high-water mark (D-015).

scalar(dd) = 1                          for dd <= start
           = floor + (1 - floor) * (stop - dd) / (stop - start)   between
           = floor                      for dd >= stop

One scalar multiplies the whole weight row, so the book's shape (and the
vol-targeting that produced it) is untouched; only its size changes.  The
live loop applies the same function to venue equity against a persisted
high-water mark.
