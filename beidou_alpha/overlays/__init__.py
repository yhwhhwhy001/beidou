"""Path-dependent overlays applied to portfolio weights: exits (stop/trail/take-profit) and exposure throttles.

Overlays are pure functions of price and weight histories.  The live loop
reuses the same per-bar step functions so backtest and live semantics are
identical by construction (D-012, D-015).
