"""R8's de-escalation ladder, as a pure state machine (D-035 / D-036).

The ladder that trades lived entirely inside `LiveEngine._risk_ladder`: an `async` private method
reading `self.store`, `self.state`, `self.config` and `self.alerts`, so nothing could evaluate it
without an engine.  Everything else that needed to know what it does therefore rewrote it.  By
2026-09-14 there were four hand-written replays in `scratchpad/` (`p32b`, `p32c`, `p32d`, `p32e`), a
second unread copy of the rung comparison in `risk_budget.attributed_drawdown_state`, and no twin at
all in `beidou_alpha` - and the replays had already drifted from the engine: one omits the
`min(1.0, raw)` clamp, one divides by a module constant rather than the running target, none replays
the blind-reading hold.

That matters beyond tidiness because those replays produced numbers that were then written down.
D-035 cites 20.5pp of CAGR, a 0.4pp rescaling cost and q95 -66.5% from code that provably is not the
code that runs.  D-036 already requires that a book-level guard have ONE semantics which the backtest
replays - satisfied for `daily_loss_pause` and `GROSS_CAPPED` through `exposure.py`, and not for the
ladder, which is the much larger scalar.

So the rule lives here, in `beidou_alpha`, next to the guards that made the same journey: pure, total,
and importing nothing from `beidou_*` so the backtest may use it.  `Policy` keeps the NUMBERS (R10:
thresholds live in code, behind `policy_digest`) and delegates the rule; the engine keeps the I/O it
needs - reading the record, persisting the standing rung, paging the operator - and holds no branch of
its own.
