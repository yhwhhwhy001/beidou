    ``priced`` is the book's net return at multiples already priced (`validate`'s cost_stress cells),
    ``price`` re-prices the same book at any m >= 0, and ``view`` picks the bars the mean is taken
    over.  Reported, never enforced.

    Why a secant and then re-pricing, rather than solving on the cells alone.  For a FIXED executed book
    the mean is exactly affine in m: the scaled charge is m times turnover and gross, while funding and
    impact are charged on that book whatever m is, so they sit in the intercept - they move m* without
    bending the line (on the book below, holding funding rather than scaling it is worth 1.3 of m*).
    The book is not fixed.  The daily-loss pause reads equity net of the scaled costs, so a dearer run
    pauses on more bars and trades a different book.  On the shipped tsmom book (pit, to 2026-09-22)
    481 pause bars at x1 became 643 at m* = 15.46, and the line through x1 and x2 missed that zero by
    0.008 of a multiple (0.013 out of sample, m* = 14.48).  The x1.5 cell sat 5e-5 off the line and
    could not show it: the drift builds up past x2, where no cell is priced.  So the secant through the
    outermost cells is only the first guess, kept as `linear_estimate`, and the book is re-priced at
    each guess until the mean is within `BREAK_EVEN_TOLERANCE` of zero.

    The mean's zero is the Sharpe's, so on the series `cost_stress` prices, "x2 >= 0" and "m* >= 2" are
    one statement wherever the mean falls with m.  It is not the gate's headroom: D-028's threshold is
    a positive Sharpe, reached at a far lower m.  Compounded return, too, reaches zero before m*.
