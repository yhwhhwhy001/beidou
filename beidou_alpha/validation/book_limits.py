"""§3's three limits beside D-018's six checks: slippage stress, correlation, turnover.

`lifecycle.Facts` has read four fields at `validated -> booked` since Phase 0, and only the first of
them - `book_checks_pass` - ever came off an artefact.  The other three were set to their passing
values in `replay.py` and listed as suspended, because **no book report carried them**: `slippage_stress`
appeared in seven validation reports and zero book reports, and correlation and turnover had no field
at all - `research correlate` wrote its own report with nothing linking it back to a book.  Three of
the four conditions on the transition were therefore decided by a literal `True` in the replay.

The arithmetic is here rather than in the CLI for two reasons.  It is pure - series in, numbers out -
so each of the three can be tested against a hand-built panel instead of against a two-hour book run;
and a limit that decides a promotion belongs beside the rules it serves rather than inside the command
that happens to print it.

**The definitions are the ones already pre-registered**, not new ones.  Every pre-registration in
`docs/RESEARCH_LOG.md` that names these limits (P27 缠论, P28's carry/xsmom arms, the funding family)
states them the same way: correlation of the candidate's NET RETURN STREAM against each running book,
signed and one-sided; and turnover as the ratio of `turnover_units` measured on the candidate ALONE,
unscaled, against the main book on the same bars ("换手 ≤ 3× tsmom（tsmom 今天 415.2 单位）").
Implementing a different normalisation - even a stricter one - would mean the artefact reports a
number the operator has never judged against, so the stricter reading is reported BESIDE the gated one
(`turnover_per_gross_ratio`) and gates nothing.  See `turnover_ratio_to_main`.
