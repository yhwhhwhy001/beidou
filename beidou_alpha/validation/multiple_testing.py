    """How often a strategy whose TRUE annual Sharpe is ``s`` clears this gate.  D-028's other half.

    ``oos_selection_threshold`` answers one question: how high must the bar be so that pure noise
    clears it at most ``alpha`` of the time.  It has never answered the question underneath it - how
    often a REAL edge clears the same bar - and the operator has now asked whether the pipeline is too
    strict four times (2026-09-17 three times, 2026-09-18 once).  Every previous answer was the word
    "no" with no number beside it, which is why the question kept coming back.  This is the number.

    The arithmetic is three lines and was available the whole time, which is the uncomfortable part.
    The OOS Sharpe estimate is asymptotically normal around the true Sharpe with the standard error
    this report already stores (``variance``, per period; annualised here by sqrt(bars_per_year)).  So
    the probability of clearing an annual gate ``g`` is ``1 - Phi((g - s) / se)``.  On the evidence
    report the registry cites (``tsmom-validation-20260913T182325Z``) that standard error is **0.44**
    over 5.16 years out of sample, and the consequences are not small:

        N=1   gate 1.000   true SR 1.0 -> 50.0%   1.5 -> 87.2%
        N=299 gate 1.574   true SR 1.0 ->  9.6%   1.5 -> 43.3%

    A true Sharpe 1.0 strategy is a coin flip against the PASS line in an EMPTY bucket, before any
    multiple-testing penalty exists.  That is not D-028's doing and cannot be fixed by moving D-028:
    it is what a five-year out-of-sample window buys.  The two things that move it are a longer sample
    (the forward board's whole purpose) and a larger true Sharpe.  Lowering ``alpha`` is the third and
    it is not available - the operator signed 0.05, and a gate loosened because a candidate failed it
    is not a gate.

    What this is NOT.  It covers the selection threshold and the pass line only, not CPCV's negative
    path share, PBO, fold consistency or the doubled-cost Sharpe.  Those are four further conditions a
    real candidate also has to satisfy, so the joint power of the pipeline is **lower** than the number
    printed here, never higher.  Stated rather than caveated away, because a power table that reads as
    an upper bound is the honest shape for this one.

    One approximation, with its size.  The standard error is the one the report measured at its own
    moments, not one re-derived at each hypothesised Sharpe.  ``sampling_variance`` is
    ``(1 - skew * sr + (kurt - 1) / 4 * sr^2) / (n - 1)`` with ``sr`` per period, and the hypothesised
    Sharpes sit within 1.0 annual of the observed one - which at 8,760 bars a year is 0.0107 per
    period.  So for a skew of 1.0 the variance moves by about 1.1% and the annual standard error by
    about 0.5%: 0.4396 against 0.4418, which moves the 43.3% cell to 43.4%.  Below the resolution of
    any decision this table is used for.
