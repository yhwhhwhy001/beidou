"""One machine applies the layers between a weight frame and a priced book, and every report says which.

The live book is four layers - signal, sleeve, exit overlay, book guards - and six research commands
score some subset of it.  Until now each command spelled its own subset inline, which produced two
different problems that are worth keeping apart, because only one of them is a defect.

**Not a defect: the commands disagree on purpose.**  `research overlay` scores the BARE ensemble, and
that is a written protocol - `docs/RESEARCH_LOG.md` (2026-09-08) states it in as many words, "判据评的
是不带 shipped exits 的裸 ensemble（`research overlay` 的既有协议，原 D-017 证据同样如此），所以它与
历史裁决可比".  Making it apply the shipped exits would break comparability with every D-017 ruling.
`research book` prices a sleeve's marginal contribution on `bare` weights plus the band, which is what
D-018 was pre-registered on.  `correlate` wants net-return streams without path-dependent layers.
Three books, three reasons.

**The defect is that the artefact could not tell them apart.**  Of the five report kinds, only
`validation` recorded `book_guards` and `exits`; `overlay`, `book`, `correlate` and `mine` recorded
`costs` and nothing else.  So a reader holding an overlay report's 1.85 and a validation report's 1.59
had nothing in either file saying they are not the same book - and the two ARE quoted against each
other, which is the mistake `_MARGIN_BUFFER_NOTE` and `_caliber_note` were written to stop one level up.

**The second defect is `research backtest`, which had no way to apply the overlay at all.**  Not a
protocol: no `--exits` flag existed, so the command could not score the book the loop holds even when
asked, and its Sharpe sat 0.058 below `validate`'s on identical inputs for that reason alone.

So: `score_book` is the one implementation of "apply the overlay, then price", and `layers_applied` is
what puts the answer in the file.  Neither changes what any command CHOOSES to measure.
