"""Enumerate candidate expressions, deduplicate them by canonical hash, and compile survivors to signals.

The miner **proposes**; nothing here judges.  A candidate compiles to an ordinary ``SignalSpec``, so
walk-forward, CPCV, the trials ledger and the D-020/D-028 verdict decide its fate exactly as they decide a
hand-written signal's.  That is the whole difference from the V2 miner, which carried its own evaluation
stack (and whose generators are unreachable from any entry point in that tree).

**The multiple-testing rule this module exists to enforce.**  A search that evaluates 400 expressions and
reports the best one has performed 400 trials, whatever id the survivor is filed under.  Because
``parse_ledger`` filters the trials ledger *by strategy*, giving each candidate a fresh id would hide the
whole search from the DSR denominator - p-hacking with extra steps, and the exact failure D-020 exists to
stop.  So ``SearchResult`` carries ``evaluated``, the count of distinct canonical expressions the search
actually looked at, and ``declared_trials`` is what must be passed to ``research validate --prior-trials``.
Validating a mined candidate without it is not a shortcut; it is a different, wrong experiment.

    """DL-D5, block 2: the only family that reads `panel.spot` - how rich the perpetual is against spot.

    `Basis` is a log price ratio, so it is RETURN and every shape divides it by `Vol` before `Squash`
    or `Mul` will take it, exactly as `_funding_family` must.  The leaf's own docstring carries the
    pre-registered choice of writing (log ratio, level, un-annualised, no window) and why the other
    three were rejected; this docstring is about the family.

    **The question that had to be answered before a hit here could mean anything - is this the carry
    family wearing a different hat? - and it was answered by measurement, not by argument.**  Funding
    is the venue's instrument for pinning the perpetual to spot, so the two are the ends of one
    arbitrage relation and a near-collinear pair was the expected answer.  It is not what the data
    says.  Measured 2026-09-09 on 20 liquid perpetuals x 14,592 hourly bars (2025-01..2026-08), spot
    fetched from the venue and joined by `align_spot_to_perp_bars`:

    * raw leaf, pooled: corr(basis, funding(w)) = +0.27 / +0.24 / +0.23 for w = 24 / 72 / 168.
    * the node every shape here actually uses: corr(basis/vol(48), funding(w)/vol(48)) = +0.25 to
      +0.26 by Pearson but only +0.09 by Spearman - the agreement lives in the tails, not the body.
    * what the family TRADES: cs_rank(basis/vol) against cs_rank(funding(w)/vol) has a per-bar
      cross-sectional Spearman of +0.045 on the mean bar, with a 5th-95th percentile of -0.41 to
      +0.48.  On the typical bar the two order the board almost independently, and the sign of the
      relationship flips from bar to bar.
    * regressing basis/vol on funding(w)/vol gives R^2 = 0.064 / 0.064 / 0.067.  Funding accounts for
      about a fifteenth of this leaf's variance.

    Two mechanisms explain the gap and both are visible in the same data.  Binance's funding formula
    adds a constant interest term (0.01%/8h) to the premium and then clamps, so funding is not a
    monotone reading of the premium; and funding is charged on the perpetual against the multi-venue
    INDEX, while this leaf reads it against Binance spot.  Those are two different spreads, measured
    the same day: log(index / Binance spot) was +0.00000 to +0.00035 across eight majors while
    log(mark / Binance spot) was -0.00026 to -0.00067.  So the honest statement is that this family is
    NOT a restatement of carry - and that the reason is partly an artefact of which spot leg the
    venue's own formula uses, which is a caveat on the hypothesis rather than support for it.

    **The residual shape is missing on purpose and it is the one a reader will want to add.**  The
    orthogonal writing is `basis/vol - funding/vol`, and `Sum` is the only operator that can express it.
    `Sum.evaluate` adds with `fill_value=0.0`, so a NaN term enters as a zero: on the 166 of 528
    perpetuals with no spot leg, that shape evaluates to pure carry with nothing saying so - a signal
    that scores the whole board while reading spot on two thirds of it.  Adding it before `Sum`
    propagates missing values would put the exact substitution `align_spot_to_perp_bars` refuses back
    into the pipeline one layer up.

    **Both signs ship**, for the reason `_funding_family` records: `cross_sectional_rank` and `tanh`
    are odd, so each short shape is the exact mirror of its long one and "a basis candidate ranked
    first" is not information - only its margin over the baseline is.  Which sign is right is a real
    open question here (does an un-charged premium mean-revert, or does it mark the crowd that is
    about to keep being right?), and deciding it from the data that ranked it is what D-020 exists for.

    **Six of the eighteen shapes are a market-wide tilt in disguise, and that was measured too.**  The
    basis has a common level as well as a spread, and the level is nearly always on one side: on the
    same 20-symbol sample its bar-mean is negative on 98.1% of bars (median -0.000537), which is the
    sign Binance's constant interest term implies.  So `Squash(carry, s)`, which keeps the level, gives
    a POSITIVE score to only 8.9% of symbols on the mean bar - it is close to "hold the same side of
    almost everything, almost always", i.e. a directional bet on the board rather than a claim about
    which symbol is rich.  `CrossSectional(..., "rank")` removes it, and the cross-sectional part is
    the larger half anyway (84% of total variance), so the ranked arm is where the stated hypothesis
    actually lives.  The level shapes still ship - dropping them would make this family
    non-comparable with `_funding_family`, whose level shapes are exactly as one-sided - but a hit on
    one of them is a claim about market direction and its falsifier is a constant-position control,
    not a baseline book.

    **The universe is not the same universe, and that is this family's own confound.**  A basis
    candidate can only score 362 of 528 perpetuals; every other family scores all of them.  So a
    marginal over a `--baseline` book is measured across a smaller cross-section, and a Sharpe
    difference that comes from holding a third fewer names is not an edge.  The falsifier for that is
    in the pre-registration, not in the code.

    Grid choice, pre-registered: no basis-specific value at all.  The leaf takes no window (see its
    docstring), `vol_window` reuses `vol_windows[0]` as every other interaction family does, and the
    momentum leg takes `horizons`, the general return-horizon dimension, so an operator rescaling the
    search for another interval rescales it too.  That makes this the cheapest family in the module -
    18 expressions - which is the right size for a hypothesis whose most likely verdict is "already
    searched under another name".  Adding a value is a parameter; adding a fourth shape is a hypothesis
    (KILL-P6).

    Lookback is `Ret(max(horizons)) + 1` and nothing else: `Basis` reserves one bar and `Vol(48)`
    twenty-five, so at the declared grid the family's deepest shape is 721 against `max_lookback`
    1400.  Stated because `hod(60)` was not - it reserved 1464, and all eighteen of its shapes left as
    `too_long` while the grid still claimed three windows.

    ``max_lookback`` defaults just under the venue's 1,500-bar request ceiling (E-042): a signal whose
    warmup exceeds what the live loop can fetch is not a candidate, it is a bug waiting for a restart.

    The families are structural shapes, not parameter values, and that distinction is the point.  Adding
    a fourth scale to an existing family would raise ``declared_trials`` - and so the DSR bar anything
    promoted has to clear - without adding a hypothesis.  Each family here says something the others
    cannot: reversal needs a minus sign, the range family is the only reader of high and low, the regime
    family is the only interaction, the multi-horizon family is the only sum, and the funding family
    expresses carry - the one panel input no node could read until ``Funding`` existed.

    ``include_funding`` is a search-space parameter and not a panel probe, deliberately: this function
    stays deterministic and touches no data, which is the property ``research_cmd._resolve_mined`` relies
    on to re-derive a ``mined_<hash>`` id without persisting anything.  The caller narrows the space when
    its panel carries no funding.

    ``max_complexity`` is 10 rather than 8 because the contract's signed momentum-times-carry product is a
    ten-node tree - the minus sign costs two nodes.  The raise is inert on what came before, and the
    reason is monotonicity, not headroom: relaxing an upper bound can only admit trees, never drop them,
    and the recorded baseline has ``rejected["too_complex"] == 0``, so nothing that existed exceeded 8.
    Headroom is precisely what there is none of - 75 of the 225, the single largest bucket, sit *at*
    complexity 8 - so the next momentum-shaped family will land on the cap again.  Asserted rather than
    argued: the identity test enumerates the pre-``Funding`` space at both 8 and 10 and requires the same
    225 hashes in the same order.  At 8 the six negated interaction trees are charged to
    ``declared_trials`` and then dropped unscored, which is the worst of both.
