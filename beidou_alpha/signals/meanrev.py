"""Short-horizon robust mean reversion (vectorised port of ``MeanReversionEngine``).

z = (close - rolling median) / (1.4826 * rolling MAD) over ``window`` bars.
Enter against the dislocation when |z| >= z_entry (score = -clip(z / z_max)),
emit an explicit exit (0.0) once |z| < z_exit, hold in between (NaN).  A
trend gate blocks entries when the trailing move is a strong trend
(|ret_window| / (vol * sqrt(window)) > trend_gate_z), mirroring the legacy
"RANGING only" regime gate.

``max_hold_bars`` is the time stop round 1 asked for on 2026-09-03 and nobody
built (docs/RESEARCH_LOG.md:12, :23, :60; the reopen condition ruled on
2026-09-17).  It exists because this signal's information is real and its
losses are not where the information is: on the point-in-time universe the
1h cross-sectional IC is +0.0159 at NW t 7.64 and the time-series IC is
positive at all seven horizons, while the equal-notional zero-cost Sharpe is
-0.62.  The ranking is right; the tail eats it.  In the 720-bar non-overlapping
buckets the SHORT bucket's mean forward return is +14.77% - the names it sold
went up 15% on average - which is the "尾部趋势延续时持仓亏大钱" of round 1
stated in numbers.  A dislocation that keeps widening never re-enters the exit
zone, so without a clock the position is held into exactly that tail.

Off by default (``0``), so every archived meanrev report reproduces bit for bit.  **It is off because
it was measured and it does not work**, not because it is untested: on the same pit panel, eight cells
of (``trend_gate_z``, ``max_hold_bars``) all came back worse than the baseline's -0.62 zero-cost Sharpe
(-0.66 at 48 bars, -0.76/-0.80 at 12/24, down to -0.87 at the tightest gate), and the reopen condition
ruled on 2026-09-17 asked for that number to turn POSITIVE before anything goes to `validate`.

The shape of the failure is the informative part and it refutes round 1's mechanism.  Tightening the
clock and the gate does cut the absolute loss - gross -0.0981 -> -0.0637 - but it cuts it by cutting
exposure (0.062 -> 0.026), and the Sharpe gets worse doing it.  A stop that were really catching the
tail would improve return per unit of risk; this one takes the good holds out with the bad.  So
meanrev's losses are not concentrated in positions held too long, and "尾部趋势延续时持仓亏大钱"
names a real tail (the 720-bar short bucket averages +14.77% forward) that a clock cannot reach,
because that tail is already under way early in the hold.  See docs/RESEARCH_LOG.md 2026-09-17

        first bar and so hold it past the stop.  Adding the term makes the rule self-consistent - if the

    The age is counted on the position a downstream ``scores_to_targets(hold=True)`` would carry, not on
    the raw score, because that is the thing being held: sub-threshold bars are NaN here and the hold
    makes them a position.  So the trade this dates is the ffilled one, and a bar that merely re-states
    the same side - a dislocation widening from z 2.0 to 2.5 - adds to the open trade rather than
    starting a new one.  That is the case the stop exists for, so it must not reset the clock.

    **Once expired, the leg stays flat until the signal itself lets go.**  Emitting a single 0.0 and then
    allowing the next in-threshold bar to re-open would make the rule cost turnover and change nothing:
    the z that held the position past the stop is still past ``z_entry`` on the next bar.  The leg
    therefore stays at 0.0 for as long as the ffilled side is unchanged, which ends only when ``z`` falls
    back inside the exit zone (an explicit 0.0) or crosses to the other side.  Both of those are the
