"""缠论 (Chan theory) structure: merged bars -> fractals -> pens -> segments -> centres -> buy/sell points.

The 51st strategy, and the one the operator named first.  Chan theory is a family of formalisations
rather than one algorithm, so §7 of the governance plan pre-registered exactly ONE and this module
implements that one.  The rule that matters more than any of the choices below: they were written
down before this file existed, and "whichever variant scores better" is not available.

**Pre-registered formalisation** (docs/analysis/2026-09-08-autonomous-governance-51-strategies-plan.md §7):

* 包含关系 - merged left to right; while the preceding direction is up an engulfing pair becomes
  (higher high, higher low), while it is down it becomes (lower low, lower high).  Only bars <= t.
* 分型 - a top fractal at merged bar i needs bar i+1 to exist, so it is CONFIRMED at i+1's close and
  every structure is stamped with the bar that confirmed it, never with the bar that formed it.
* 笔 - between adjacent opposite confirmed fractals with at least ``min_bars`` merged bars between
  them; confirmed when the next opposite fractal confirms.
* 线段 - at least three pens that overlap (pen 1's range against pen 3's).
* 中枢 - the overlap of three consecutive segments; ZG = min of their highs, ZD = max of their lows.
* 买卖点 - a third-type buy (price left the centre upward and the pullback did not re-enter it) scores
  +1; a third-type sell scores -1; a first-type (背驰, MACD area ratio below ``div_ratio``) scores an
  explicit 0.0, which `scores_to_targets` reads as CLOSE rather than as reverse; everything else is
  deliberately sub-threshold, which the same function reads as HOLD.
* 级别 - structure is built on 1h bars, or on 4h bars when ``level`` says so.

**Causality.**  One forward pass; at every t the score is a function of the state as of t and nothing
else.  Unconfirmed structure at the right edge never scores, and a structure that is revised later
never back-fills a score that was already emitted - which is the single way a Chan implementation
usually reads the future, because the textbook draws its lines with the whole chart visible.

At the 4h level a bar's score becomes available only on the 1h bar that CLOSES it, for the same
reason: at 01:00 the 04:00 bar does not exist yet.

**Expected result, recorded before running it.**  Negative, or positive-and-highly-correlated with
tsmom.  On hourly crypto perpetuals this is trend following with a structure filter, and the
pre-registered falsifier is correlation >= 0.5 with tsmom - which would make it "tsmom rewritten"
rather than a second book.
