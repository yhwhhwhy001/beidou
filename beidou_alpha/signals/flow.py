"""Order-flow imbalance: taker-buy share of quote volume, scaled by volume expansion (new).

imbalance = taker_buy_quote / quote_volume - 0.5  over ``window`` bars
score = clip(tanh(imbalance / scale) * min(1, vol_ratio), -1, 1)

Requires ``taker_buy_quote`` and ``quote_volume`` in the panel (present in the
official archives); returns NaN otherwise.  Optionally cross-sectionally
demeaned so the book is market-neutral.

Short-side trend gate (round 5).  Perp taker *selling* into a strongly rising
market is hedging and short-selling into strength, not informed flow: the
price is being driven by spot demand the perp tape cannot see, and those
shorts are what got squeezed in 2024-11 (XRP/ADA/SUI).  With ``short_gate``
> 0 a negative score is replaced by an explicit exit (0.0) while the symbol's
weekly-scale momentum score is >= ``short_gate``.  Longs against downtrends
are deliberately left alone: the symmetric gate destroyed the 2022 bear-market
folds, where dip-buying flow was the profitable leg.

    """Scores; ``volume_warmup_fill`` decides what the expansion multiplier is before it is warm.

    ``expansion`` lives in (0, 1] and multiplies the imbalance, so ``fillna(1.0)`` is its UPPER bound,
    not a neutral value: on a bar where the ratio is unknown the score is computed as though volume had
    expanded as much as it ever can.  That is a lean toward taking the position, in a signal whose
    shipped use is the short-only ``flow_short`` probe.

    WHERE it is reachable was measured before this knob was written, because the answer is not the one
    the shape suggests.  The review's reading was the warm-up head: ``imbalance`` needs ``window`` bars
    and the score is masked where it is NaN, so the fill shows only on ``volume_window < t <= window``,
    which is bars 25-48 under this class's defaults and EMPTY under the shipped registry (``window``
    168 against ``volume_window`` 48).  On the point-in-time panel (205 symbols, 49,937 bars,
    2021-01-01..2026-09-12) the count of bars the fill actually reaches under the registry's own
    parameters is 4,284 - and every single one of them comes from the OTHER NaN in ``volume_ratio``:
    ``baseline.where(baseline > 0)``, a symbol whose trailing 48-bar mean volume is exactly zero.
    36 symbols, 238 of the 4,284 inside the eligible/point-in-time mask.

    Which makes the fill's meaning worse than "aggressive during warm-up": a symbol that has stopped
    quoting for two days is scored as though its volume were expanding as hard as it can.  It is the
    same population O4's ``dead_slot_share`` counts - a 30-day trailing volume keeps ranking a name
    that no longer prints - reached through a different door.

    The default still does not move.  `flow_short` is ENABLED, ``None`` changes 238 in-universe cells
    from a value to a hold/NaN, and `scores_to_targets` carries values forward, so this is a live
    change and therefore the operator's to price - not a correction to slip in beside four that are
    bit-identical.
