"""The hourly check was FAILing every hour.  Was the operator being told?

`WebhookAlerts` deduplicates on `time.monotonic()` and persists those values to a JSON file so that
the hourly check job - a fresh process every hour - can suppress a standing problem down to one line
per hour (KILL-R7's fix).  But `time.monotonic()` is only comparable INSIDE one boot: its epoch is
the machine's last boot.  A value written before a reboot is a number from a different frame, and
after a reboot it can be LARGER than the current uptime.

`_suppressed` computes `clock() - last < window`.  With a stored value from a longer-running previous
boot that difference is NEGATIVE, so it is always below the window: the key is suppressed for as long
as it takes uptime to catch up, and nothing inside the boot clears it.

This asks the real class, on the real state file, rather than re-deriving the arithmetic.  Measured
2026-09-14 before the fix, on a machine booted 2026-09-10 12:47:

    check-verify  stored 630465.2  uptime 374798.0  clock-last = -255667  ->  suppressed
                  from_a_previous_boot: true        silent for another 71.0 hours

Rows written after the fix carry a wall reading beside the monotonic one, and this reports both, so
the same command answers the same question before and after.  Read-only: it constructs the object
with no webhook url and never calls `send`.
