"""What the shipped `daily_loss_pause -0.05` buys at k=0.60, and what the book looks like without it.

A REPLAY of the construction that trades, not a search: the only arms are the shipped setting and the
guard switched off, which is the control the config comment for `vol_target 0.30` already took at the
old k ("daily_loss_pause fires about once a year ... 0 times in 5.6 years at 0.15; 5 and 4 times at
0.30").  That reading has never been taken at 0.60.  No ledger row is written and none is owed:
nothing here picks a new threshold.

The comparison is deliberately marginal - guard on vs the SAME weights with the guard off - so the
difference is the guard and not the construction.  `gross_capped` stays on in both arms, because
turning both guards off would measure a book the loop would not hold (KILL-027's shape).
