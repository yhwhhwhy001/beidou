"""P32h: `p32g`'s `k` sweep again, with the ladder stepped against the base that is actually in force.

THE DEFECT.  `p32g`'s ladder arm calls `p32d.ladder`, which hands `ladder_step` `base=K` - `p32e`'s module
constant, 0.60.  `LiveEngine._risk_ladder` hands it `self.config.portfolio.vol_target`: the `k` that is
running.  The rungs the shipped rule derives for a `k` are ABSOLUTE targets, `0.75k` and `0.50k`
(`p32d.rescaled`), and `rung_scalar(target, base)` is what turns a target into the multiplier on the book:

    live     0.75k / k    = 0.75     0.50k / k    = 0.50
    p32g     0.75k / 0.60 = 1.25k    0.50k / 0.60 = 0.833k

The same at k=0.60.  Below it `p32g` brakes K/k times harder than the rule it transcribes: 2.0x at 0.30
(the first rung takes the book to 0.375 where the rule asks for 0.75), 1.71x at 0.35, 1.2x at 0.50.
`p32d` and `p32f` only ever ran k=0.60, where the constant IS the base, so neither could show it.
`p32d.ladder_legacy`'s docstring already names this defect in the hand-written replay ("`standing / K`
divides by a module constant rather than by the base actually in force"); the swap to `ladder_step` fixed
the arithmetic and carried the constant over as an argument.

`p32d` and `p32g` are left exactly as they ran.  Their numbers are what RESEARCH_LOG 2026-09-22 and
`governance/reopen.yaml`'s `drawdown-budget-denominator` cite, and rewriting the evidence under a claim is
how a record stops being one - the reason `p32d` gives for leaving `p32c` alone.

ARMS, per `k`, all PAIRED on the one set of block starts `p32g` draws for that `k`:

* `ladder@0.60` - `p32g`'s ladder arm verbatim, through `p32d.ladder`.  A CONTROL, not a result: it must
  reproduce `PUBLISHED` cell for cell, or the data moved underneath and the next arm cannot be read as
  "only the base changed".
* `ladder@k` - the same rungs stepped with `base=k`: what the loop does at `vol_target = k`.
* `no ladder` - `p32g`'s, and a second control: with no rungs the base is never read.
* `running`, at k=0.60 only - `Policy().drawdown_ladder`, the total-equity rungs that trade today.  `p32g`
  priced its "about 45pp" against `p32f`'s 119.2%, a run on 2026-09-20 data with 96 fewer bars and so
  other block starts; here the baseline sits on the same draws as the arms it is subtracted from.

`EXTENDED` goes below `p32g`'s grid, which spans the two values the operator has declared (0.60 trading;
0.30 before it and `rollback_to`), because under the corrected base the first `k` that holds may not be on
that grid.  Its rows are measurements, not a proposal.

THE BAND is `p32d.panel_series`'s, deliberately: `combine_books` applies D2 (`flat_inside_band`) but not D3
(`band_entry_multiple`), where the live rebalancer applies both.  `p32g` measured on that D2-only band, so
keeping it is what lets `ladder@k` differ from the published arm in the base and in nothing else.
Whether `combine_books` gets D3 is a separate ruling.

THE STATIC UNIVERSE is pinned, which `p32g` did not do.  `p32g` resolved it from `universe.json`, and the
live loop rewrites that file every day; at 2026-09-23T01:00:21Z AKEUSDT entered - after `p32g` ran - so
`p32g static` stopped reproducing from the file.  Measured the same day: read from the file, its k=0.30
ladder row comes out -65.8% / 1.8% / 66.1% (q95 USDT / P / CAGR) against a published -66.8% / 2.0% /
64.7%; pinned to `STATIC_P32G`, all 12 published rows come back cell for cell.  Pit reads the membership
table, which has not moved since 2026-09-18.

`p32f`'s three caveats carry over unchanged and still all point the same way (the real tail is worse):
A-003's weekly block bootstrap, the USDT conversion's assumption that the loss lands in USDT, and CAGR
levels that only mean anything as differences.

WHAT THIS IS NOT.  `vol_target` is inside the construction fingerprint frozen to 2026-10-13.  This corrects
an input to that ruling; it moves nothing.
