"""P32g: which `k` holds a 70% budget on the money that can actually trade?

`p32f` answered the question the 2026-09-20 ruling asked first - re-denominate the BUDGET to tradable
USDT, let the shipped rule re-derive the rungs - and the answer was that it buys nothing: about 13pp of
CAGR for a tail still past a total loss of the tradable money, breached in 94.5% of draws.  Its third
conclusion was that the rungs are not the lever, because the MEDIAN 5.6-year draw already gives back
51.6% of total equity, which is 96% of what can trade.  The remaining lever is `k`.

So this sweeps `k` and asks, for each one, whether q95 of the tradable drawdown lands inside -70%.

TWO ARMS PER `k`, and the second is the reason this is not just `p32f` in a loop:

* `ladder` - `k` with the USDT-denominated rungs the shipped rule derives for it.  Note what does and
  does not move with `k`: the LEVELS stay at -26.3% / -37.6%, because those are a property of the
  account's composition and of the declared budget, not of `k`; the TARGETS are `0.75k` and `0.50k`.
* `no ladder` - the same `k` with no rungs at all.  Without it the sweep cannot say whether a `k` that
  holds the budget holds it because the book is smaller or because the brake fires more often, and
  those two have very different costs.

`p32f`'s three caveats carry over unchanged and still all point the same way (the real tail is worse):
the weekly block bootstrap destroys multi-month regime structure (A-003); the USDT conversion assumes
the loss lands in USDT, which understates a joint BTC-and-book fall; and the CAGR levels are an
artifact of bootstrapping a leveraged crypto momentum book, so only differences mean anything.

WHAT THIS IS NOT.  `vol_target` is inside the construction fingerprint frozen to 2026-10-13; moving it
resets M-010, M-G06 and `realised_vol`.  This run produces an input to that ruling, not an action.

#: Re-measured 2026-09-22: USDT peak 7,489.95 over total-equity peak 13,251.98.  `p32f` ran at
#: 0.537441 (6,647.18 / 12,368.22) two days earlier, so this moved **+5.16% in two days** - and that
#: is not drift to average away, it is the quantity's own behaviour.  The collateral line is nearly
#: static (5.25% of summed absolute equity moves, measured over 269 cycles), so every unit the book
#: earns lands in USDT and raises USDT's share of the account.  **The more the book makes, the
#: shallower the same total-equity drawdown reads in tradable terms.**
#:
#: So this is not a constant of the account and must not be treated as one.  It is pinned to a date
#: here rather than read from the live record, because a research script that reads live state gives
#: a different answer every time it runs and stops being reproducible.  The cost of pinning is that
#: it goes stale, which is why `p32f`'s value is kept beside it: the two together say how fast.
