"""Calibrate the probe stop on the caliber its evidence is in.  Pre-registered 2026-09-12 at b883d01e.

The live stop reads a realised-income series whose 30-day sigma is 0.137% of equity, while the sleeve's
evidence is a mark-to-market P&L whose 30-day sigma is about 2.34% - so `-2%` sits at 14.6 sigma of the
series it reads and 0.85 sigma of the series it was calibrated against.  Neither is the "-2 sigma"
D-019 claimed.

This recomputes, over the panel the book report was validated on, each book's own 30-day rolling
mark-to-market P&L as a share of equity, and takes the EMPIRICAL 2.28% quantile (= Phi(-2)) - not
2 x sigma, because a 30-day rolling sum is fat-tailed and autocorrelated and the normal assumption is
where this rule went wrong in the first place.

Measures the configuration already in force.  No grid, no selection, no comparison: not a trial, so no
ledger row (stated in the pre-registration).
