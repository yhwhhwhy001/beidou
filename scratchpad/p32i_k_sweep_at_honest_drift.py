"""P32i: `p32h`'s k sweep with one more arm - the same book with its drift discounted to the honest OOS Sharpe.

WHY.  The 2026-09-25 backtest-guard audit, first pass, first item (`docs/analysis/2026-09-25-backtest-guard-
audit.md`): every pricing of `k` so far block-bootstraps the net return series of the configuration the
full sample picked.  A bootstrap keeps the series' mean, so the K table's CAGR, q95 drawdown and P(breach)
all ride a drift the selection lifted.  The honest selection procedure delivers `oos_selection.
oos_sharpe_annual` in the evidence the registry cites (`reports/research/tsmom-validation-20260919T081914Z.
json`, 1.2306); the full-sample number beside it is 1.6670.

THE ARM.  Per panel - one universe, one `k` - subtract ONE constant `c` from every bar's net return, so
that the whole series' annualised Sharpe equals that OOS value.  A constant moves the mean and nothing
else: the standard deviation, the autocorrelation, the ordering and every block the bootstrap draws are
the series' own.  `c` is solved in closed form and then CHECKED with the repository's own estimator
(`multiple_testing.sharpe_per_period` x sqrt(`bars_per_year("1h")`), the one `oos_sharpe_annual` is made
of - ddof 1, 8760 bars a year), not asserted.  `realised` takes the same `c`; the mtm ruler every arm
below uses never reads it (`p32h.ladder_at_base` only accumulates `path` for the realised ruler).

Note what the target is and is not: tsmom's single-book OOS Sharpe, applied as a haircut to the whole
registry book `p32d.panel_series` builds (tsmom + the flow_short sleeve, exits, guards).  It prices "the
drift the selection lifted", which is the audit's ask; it is not a claim that this book's own OOS Sharpe
is 1.2306.

Because the panel's own full-sample Sharpe moves with `k` (pit: 1.70 at 0.60, 1.91-1.96 at 0.15-0.30),
one target for every `k` takes a larger share of the drift the smaller `k` is.  `--drifts prop` runs the
other end as a sensitivity, NOT the audit's arm: each panel keeps the share of its own Sharpe that the
evidence's book kept out of sample (OOS / `full_sample.annualized_sharpe`, 1.2306 / 1.6670 = 0.738).

EVERYTHING ELSE IS `p32h`'s, imported rather than copied: `p32h.panel` (the static universe pinned to
`STATIC_P32G`), `p32h.run_arm` (the loop, `ladder_at_base`, the USDT conversion), `p32h.crossing`; `SEED`,
`BLOCK`, 2000 draws, one set of block starts per `k` shared by every arm - so each honest cell is PAIRED
with the published cell beside it.  The USDT conversion factor is `p32g`'s pin by default: the USDT
share of the account at its 2026-09-22 peak, 7,489.95 / 13,251.98 = 0.5652, a factor of 1.769.  It has
drifted since (1.748 in the daily reports of 2026-09-23 to 09-25); keeping p32h's is what lets the
original arm reproduce.  `--factor-report` takes a daily report's `risk_budget.usdt_drawdown.
vs_total_equity` instead - the same quantity, total-equity peak over USDT peak - and the date is printed
with every table either way.

THE DATA END is pinned, which `p32h` did not need to do on the day it ran: `p32d.panel_series` loads the
store to its newest bar and the store grows by a daily sync.  The published panels ended at the bar
opened 2026-09-22 16:00Z (pit 49,456 bars, static 49,457); `KlineStore.load` keeps `open_time < end`, so
`END` is 17:00.  The pin goes where the lookup happens - `p32d`'s namespace - and is counted, like
`p32h`'s static pin.  A different bar count stops the run: the block starts are drawn from `n`.

THE STORE ITSELF moved under that end after the published runs, for three names (`STORE_0923`).  Pinned
to `END` alone, pit k=0.30 differs from the archived series in its last 461 bars (from 2026-09-03 12:00,
up to 0.006 a bar).  `--store 0923` reads those three names as they stood before the writes, and the
anchor then has to come back bit for bit; `--store today` reads the store as it is (the backfills are
real data the published runs lacked).  Nothing is written to the store either way: two class methods are
wrapped for the life of the panel build, in this process only.

`STORE_0923` covers the writes up to 2026-09-25 11:36Z and no further.  Then `data repair` (9.4) filled
holes in 21 1h files, 4 of them in the pit union (BNX, OCEAN, OGN, RSR; none in `STATIC_P32G`), and it
records what no source held (`confirmed_gaps.json`), not the bars it added.  Since then `--store 0923`
still reproduces static bit for bit and pit stops at the anchor, as it should: the 2026-09-25 outputs
archived at `reports/research/p32i-20260925/` are the record, not a rerun.

TWO CODE BASES, one script.  `p32h`'s table was measured with D2 alone in `combine_books`; #115
(`227a6348`) gave the multi-book path D3, so on `main` the original arm no longer reproduces that table
(RESEARCH_LOG 2026-09-23, "多书研究路径的再平衡带少一条规则" §五).  Run this in a worktree at `555be470`
(the last `main` commit that reproduces it) for the D2 table, and at `main` for D2+D3.  Which band a
run measured is not asserted either: `--band` states it and `--anchor-dir` checks it.  Pointed at the
series and bootstrap output that section wrote - archived since #154 at `reports/research/k-scan-20260923/`
- the rebuilt series are compared bit for bit with its `d2` and `d3` series, and the rows with its `kgrid`
output at full precision.

CHECKS, in the order they can stop the run:
1. bar count = the published one; the data-end pin and the static pin each took exactly once
2. (with `--anchor-dir`) rebuilt series bit-identical to the archived series of the stated band
3. every discounted series: annualised Sharpe = its target, std and lag-1 autocorrelation unchanged
4. original arms vs the published table at its printed precision - RESEARCH_LOG "k 扫描的更正" §3 for
   D2, the D3 section's table for D2+D3 - and (with `--anchor-dir`) vs `kgrid` at full precision

`--drifts` picks the series the ladder arms run on (orig, honest, prop) and `--no-controls` drops `no ladder`
and `ladder@0.60`, so an extension point or a sensitivity arm does not re-buy cells already measured.  Every
`k` draws its own block starts from `SEED` and `n`, so runs split by `k` or by arm are one computation;
`scratchpad/p32i_merge_runs.py` merges them and refuses if two runs disagree on anything they share.

Zero ledger: reads the store, the membership table, the evidence JSON and config; writes only
`scratchpad/p32i-*.json` under the working directory.  The 2026-09-25 runs are archived at
`reports/research/p32i-20260925/` (RESEARCH_LOG "p32i：诚实漂移下补测 0.15").
