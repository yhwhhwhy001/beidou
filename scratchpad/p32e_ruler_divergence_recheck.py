"""Independent re-derivation of `p32e`'s backtest half, plus the check it did not run.

Reproduces the four numbers the 2026-09-14 pre-registration (`ede008c9`) cites for k=0.60 - pit
mark-to-market -39.85% / realised -21.27%, 785 bars past the first rung against 0; static -35.29% /
-24.13%, 1 against 0 - from the same construction entry points, with the realised/mark split written
here rather than imported, so agreement is evidence and not a tautology.

The check `p32e` did not run, and the reason this file exists rather than a note saying "I re-ran it":
the whole finding rests on the realised/mark split, and that split has exactly one free choice - WHEN
an open position's paper P&L becomes realised.  A conclusion that depends on the convention is a
conclusion about the convention, so this brackets it:

  eager         realised == mark                  book instantly; the degenerate upper bound
  proportional  book on every shrink, in proportion    `p32e`'s convention
  on_close      book only on a flat or a flip     the most lagging realistic convention

More eager booking tracks the mark path more closely, drives the realised drawdown DEEPER and makes a
rung crossing MORE likely.  `p32e` therefore already picked the end of the realistic range that most
favours crossing; measured here, it still gives zero.  `eager` crosses 785 times, which is the sanity
check that the instrument can fire at all.

Read-only.  Klines, membership and the live record are shared with the running loop and with other
worktrees: this opens them and writes nothing.
