"""P32f: the two audit findings that are measurable without a decision.

1. HOW MUCH IS THE OPEN CPCV BOUNDARY WORTH?  `cpcv_splits`' docstring says the embargo should be
   sized by the model's FEATURE LOOKBACK (tsmom `max(horizons)` 720, `AlphaModel.warmup_bars` 1442)
   and the callers pass `embargo = purge = 50`, leaving ~670 contaminated bars in the training set of
   every "after" group - bars `cpcv_evaluate` then selects parameters on.  `fraction_negative` is one
   of D-020's four hard gates, so the contamination makes a gate easier to pass.  The boundary is
   recorded as OPEN because closing it means a pre-registered re-run that charges the trials ledger.
   This measures the SIZE of the effect without charging anything: same nets, same groups, embargo
   varied.  A diagnostic that writes no ledger row is free; `research validate` is not.

2. IS THE EDGE DECAYING, AND HOW FAST?  `signals/tsmom.py:7-11` states the edge is behavioural and
   "should be expected to decay", and no round has ever estimated the rate - while k just doubled.
   This reports the per-year Sharpe of the shipped book and the OLS trend through it, with the
   standard error, so "we cannot pin a half-life from five annual observations" is a measurement
   rather than an impression.
