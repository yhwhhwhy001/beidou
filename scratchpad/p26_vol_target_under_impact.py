"""P26: the vol-target k under the DL-C1 impact model, by capital.  Pre-registered in RESEARCH_LOG.

Written before it ran; a correction is made here rather than in a second place.

`vol_target` has been a free parameter in every backtest this repository has produced, because the
cost model charges the same bps for any order size - an arithmetic property of the pricing, not a
finding about the world.  The impact model breaks that, so the argmax k becomes finite and there is
finally a capital at which the shipped 0.30 has to be re-derived rather than assumed.

**This run adopts nothing.**  Changing `vol_target` is a construction change: it belongs in batch
window #1, and it would reset M-010's 30-day clock, which has been running unbroken since
2026-09-04T15:02Z.  The output is a curve.

Two control rows, declared before the sweep because what they falsify is this measurement rather than
the strategy:

* capital 0, guards OFF - net Sharpe must be identical across all seven k, to the last digit.  If it
  is not, this harness is measuring a bug.
* capital 0, guards ON - Sharpe is ALLOWED to move with k, and that movement is the guards, not
  impact.  Measured on 2026-09-04: doubling the vol target made both guards reachable (355 capped
  bars, 36 paused bars on the point-in-time universe).  Without this row, impact would be credited
  with the guards' k-dependence.

Writes nothing: no ledger row, no report, no config.  Construction parameters do not enter
`param_key`, so the new cells are declared as prior-trials debt in RESEARCH_LOG, on D-039's precedent.
