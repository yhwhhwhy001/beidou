"""P32f: what the de-escalation ladder becomes when the budget is declared in TRADABLE USDT.

The operator ruled on 2026-09-20 that the drawdown they are budgeting is the tradable money's, not the
account's.  `Policy.drawdown_ladder` is not a set of numbers someone chose - it is the shipped rule
transcribed, `deescalate_at = 0.70 * budget` and `rollback_at = budget` - so the ruling does not edit
two thresholds, it re-denominates the ONE parameter they are derived from, and the rungs follow.

`p32d` is left exactly as it ran: its numbers are what D-035 cites, and rewriting the evidence under a
claim is how a record stops being one (the reason `p32d` itself gives for not touching `p32c`).  This
imports its ladder replay and its panel, and adds one arm.

THE CONVERSION, and its one assumption.  The backtest's equity is the equity positions are sized off,
which live is TOTAL equity - the backtest models no collateral at all (RISK-G11).  A loss of L reads as
L/E_peak there and as L/U_peak to the operator, so a budget of 70% of USDT is a budget of 70% *
U_peak/E_peak in the units this replay works in.  On 2026-09-20 that factor is 6,647.18 / 12,368.22 =
0.5374, giving 37.62%.

The assumption is that the loss lands in USDT.  That is what settlement does, and the live record says
the collateral line barely participates: over the 269 cycles carrying both readings, 5.25% of the summed
absolute equity moves were collateral, whose whole range was 62.09 U (1.09% of its mean) while BTC's own
range over the same window was 7.28%.  Where it fails is a joint move - BTC down while the book is down -
and there the conversion UNDERSTATES the tradable drawdown, because E_peak falls too.  So the arm below
is the optimistic one, stacked on a block bootstrap that is already optimistic by construction (A-003).
