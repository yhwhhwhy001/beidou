"""G8: break each rule the break-even tests guard, one at a time, and check that some test goes red.

The mutation readings behind `docs/RESEARCH_LOG.md` 2026-09-23 · G8 (「变异 13 个」).  Every mutation is an
exact-text edit made in a COPY of the tree, never in the tree this is run from; the copy is checked
green before anything is planted.  If an anchor no longer exists the script stops and names it, rather
than reporting a mutation it never made as caught.  `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE` is set and every
`__pycache__` removed before each run: an equal-length edit inside the same second leaves a stale
`.pyc` valid, and the unmutated code would be what ran.

    .venv/bin/python scratchpad/g8_break_even_mutations.py

About 30 s.  Prints RED (a test caught it) or SURVIVED per mutation, and the tests that went red.
