"""P32e: the ruler R8 actually reads, against the ruler P32b/P32c/p32d replayed it with.

E-015 recorded this as a limitation with the net effect unquantified.  After the 2026-09-14 audit it
is decisive rather than marginal: the whole value of the shipped ladder in `p32d`'s method B comes
from it firing inside a deep drawdown, and the live ruler may not see that drawdown at all.

The two rulers, read off `beidou_live/risk_budget.py:223-262`:

  live   `path = base + cumsum(attributed)`, base = the account's TOTAL equity at the first priced
         cycle (52.65% of it non-USDT collateral today), and `attributed` counts income rows only -
         realised P&L, funding and fees.  Unrealised P&L is invisible to it.  The path is LINEAR in
         USDT, not compounding.
  replay `equity *= 1 + net`, i.e. the book's own mark-to-market NAV.  Every adverse bar shows up the
         moment it happens.

A momentum book holds losers unrealised, so the live ruler must lag.  This measures by how much, on
the same 2021-2026 panel the k decision was made on, plus the divergence already visible on the 295
live cycles.

Realised-P&L reconstruction: per symbol, mark-to-market P&L accumulates in an unrealised bucket and
is booked when the position shrinks, proportionally to the shrink (average-cost convention, which is
what a cross-margin venue uses); a sign flip books all of it.  Fees and funding are realised on the
bar they are charged.  By construction `cumsum(realised) + unrealised == cumsum(mark-to-market)` at
every bar, which the script asserts.

APPROXIMATIONS, stated because they bound what this can claim:
  * the ladder's scalar is applied to the realised NET series rather than re-deriving the weight path
    (P32b's approximation, inherited): P&L is linear in position size, so scaling the book by s scales
    both rulers by s, but turnover cost is scaled with the position instead of re-derived.
  * `base` is taken as the book's own equity (1.0).  Live's base is the TOTAL account equity, which is
    LARGER than the book's - so the same realised loss is a SMALLER fraction of it and live triggers
    even later than this reports.  The bias runs with the finding, not against it.
