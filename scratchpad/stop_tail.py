"""The loss a per-symbol stop is FOR: the worst drawdown of cumulative P&L inside one holding episode.

P11-b (2026-09-04) adopted `stop_loss: 6.0` on the operator's instruction while recording that its own
second criterion had FAILED: the worst single-name episode loss was identical to three decimals with and
without the stop, at every distance in the grid.  That table is `docs/RESEARCH_LOG.md`'s, and it is the
reason the config comment says the stop "protects nothing measurable".  The script that produced it was
called `scratchpad/stop_tail.py` and was never committed - `.gitignore` says scratchpad scripts ARE
committed precisely because they reproduce adoption decisions, so this is the rule being repaired, not
an exception being made.  This file rebuilds the measurement from the definition the log states.

Portfolio OOS MDD cannot see this quantity: it is a portfolio statistic and averages a single name's
slow bleed away.  D-017 is scored on it anyway, which is why widening a from-entry stop from 4 to 8
moves OOS Sharpe and MDD while leaving the per-episode tail bit-identical.

DEFINITION (from the log, restated so a reader need not trust this file's arithmetic):
  episode  = a maximal run of bars on which one symbol's HELD weight keeps the same non-zero sign
  loss     = min over the episode of (cumulative net P&L - its running maximum, floor 0 at entry)
  unit     = fraction of equity, because `BacktestResult.net` is already per-bar equity fraction

"20 worst" is ambiguous in the log's table header, so BOTH readings are printed; whichever reproduces
-32.59% (pit) / -38.04% (static) at vol_target 0.15 is the log's, and the other is labelled as not it.

The exit settings below are exactly the four P11-b reported.  Trailing distances are deliberately NOT
here: they are the subject of a pre-registration that has to be written before it is run, and adding
them to this file would be running first.  Backtest call matches `research overlay` (no book guards).
