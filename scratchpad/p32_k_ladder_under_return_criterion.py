"""P32: the vol-target ladder priced under the OPERATOR'S criterion - absolute return, not Sharpe.

NOT pre-registered, and the first version of this docstring said it was.  It claimed "PRE-REGISTERED
before it ran (RESEARCH_LOG entry of the same date)"; there is no 2026-09-14 entry in RESEARCH_LOG and
no occurrence of "P32" anywhere in docs/ or config/.  The grid and the reading WERE written before the
run - in the session transcript, which is not a durable artefact and is not what this repository means
by pre-registration (P30/P31 both committed theirs first).  Corrected rather than deleted, because a
script that certifies its own provenance is exactly the thing the certificate is supposed to prevent.
Anything downstream must therefore NOT cite a pre-registered selection rule for this run.

Adopts nothing, writes no config, no report and no ledger row; the output is a priced ladder.

WHY THIS IS NOT P26 AGAIN.  P26 (2026-09-08) swept the same k grid and read `annualized_sharpe`,
finding argmax 0.15 at every capital.  Under a RETURN criterion that table says something different
and P26 never printed it: net return is roughly linear in k while Sharpe decays a few percent, so
the argmax of return is the largest k that survives the risk constraints.  This run prints return,
drawdown and the ruin diagnostics P26 did not.

WHY IT IS NOT THE ADOPTION BOOTSTRAP AGAIN.  `vol_target_drawdown_bootstrap.py` scored
`model.book_names[0]` - the MAIN book alone.  The book that trades is main + flow_short + exits +
book guards, and it runs at 0.842x main's ex-ante vol (measured live 2026-09-13).  So the 50%
budget was priced on a book that is not the one at risk.  This run scores the registry book.

GRID: reuses the bootstrap's already-declared TARGETS.  No new k values are invented, because
inventing them after seeing P26's curve is exactly the selection pollution D-039 makes us pay for.

THE ONE NON-NEGOTIABLE.  The operator has said the drawdown budget is re-negotiable.  Ruin is not:
any rung whose `liquidation_touches` > 0 or `min_margin_buffer` <= 1.0 is refused regardless of
return, and that refusal is not an opinion the operator can overrule with a bigger budget.
