"""DL-C1 / KILL-A: where the flat cost model stops being a good approximation, by capital.

Written before it ran, so a correction is made in one place.

The backtest is scale-free by arithmetic - gross P&L, turnover cost and funding are all linear in the
weights, so scaling every weight by k leaves the Sharpe identical to the last digit.  That is what makes
`vol_target` a free parameter in the backtest and it is the assumption KILL-Q12 has held real capital
out of scope on since 2026-09-05.  `ImpactModel` breaks the identity on purpose: the square-root law
charges more per unit as the order grows against ADV, so the same book has a different Sharpe at every
account size and there is finally a size at which k has to be re-derived.

**What this can and cannot say.**  The coefficient is an assumption (equities literature, E5 for this
venue) and this system cannot calibrate it.  Read the KNEE, not the levels: the capital at which cost
share starts to bend is a structural statement about this book's turnover against this universe's
depth, and it moves with the coefficient only as sqrt - a coefficient of 0.25 halves every delta.

CORRECTION, made after the first run and left here rather than rewritten: this docstring predicted
"under a hundredth of a basis point" at demo notional, from an order/ADV of about 1e-8.  Measured, the
model attributes about 8.6% of total cost to impact at 10,000 USDT - roughly 0.7 bps, not 0.007.  The
estimate was wrong because it used the liquid names' ADV for the whole book: the thin end of an
18-symbol perp universe is where participation actually bites.  What survives is the conclusion, for a
different reason than stated: 0.7 bps sits well inside the [2.01, 9.19] bps interval of the 101 demo
fills, so that sample can neither confirm nor refute the model - it is not that impact is too small to
matter at demo scale, it is that it is too small to SEPARATE from spread.

It writes nothing - no ledger row, no report, no config.  Scored on the same four layers `research
validate` scores: registry book (tsmom + the flow_short sleeve), exits from the profile, book guards.
