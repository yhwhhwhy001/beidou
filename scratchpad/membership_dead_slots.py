"""O4: how often does the point-in-time universe hold a slot with no market data behind it?

A 30-day trailing quote volume keeps ranking a symbol that has stopped quoting, so a name can occupy
one of `top_n` slots for up to a month after its last bar.  This builds the `available` frame
`membership_summary` needs - "did this symbol have a 1h bar on this refresh day?" - and prints what it
finds.  `pool.py` deliberately does not read the archive, so this is where the I/O lives.

    BEIDOU_DATA_ROOT=/path/to/.beidou/data PYTHONPATH=. python scratchpad/membership_dead_slots.py

Measured 2026-09-13 on the shipped archive: 2,042 refreshes, 35,899 member-refresh slots, 109 dead
(0.30%), on 104 refresh days (5.1%), worst 2 of 18 on 2026-07-18.  0.30% changes no conclusion - the
reason to compute it is that a measured 0.30% and an unmeasured unknown are different answers.

The split is the part a single share hides, and it is why this prints per symbol: 28 of the 109 are
LUNAUSDT's delisting tail (last 1h bar 2022-05-13, member until 2022-06-10), and the other 81 belong
to six 2026 names - SKYAI, SYN, BLESS, ALLO, RE, ENSO - whose 1h archive has never been backfilled.
`research --universe pit` already prints those six as "member symbols have no 1h klines yet", so they
are a sync gap wearing a universe defect's clothes; the fix for them is a download, not a rule change.
