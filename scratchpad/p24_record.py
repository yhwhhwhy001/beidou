"""P24: write the two declared diagnostic trials to the ledger, one row per (candidate x universe x entry).

Separate from `exit_paired_ruler.py` on purpose: the measurement must be repeatable without charging, and
a failed measurement must not half-charge the ledger.  Rows are built with the SAME helpers
`beidou research overlay` uses (`_construction_digest`, `_symbol_set_hash`, `_short_digest`,
`param_key`, `_record_trials`), so a P24 row is indistinguishable in kind from a row a real overlay run
would have written - which is the point: it IS the same kind of trial.

Charge, corrected before writing.  The pre-registration said "each arm once, tsmom +2 / flow +2".  That
was wrong about this repository's own convention: P22b wrote 8 rows for 2 candidates
(2 candidates x 2 universes x 2 entries) and its log records tsmom 100 -> 104, i.e. +4 per strategy.
P24 has the same shape, so the honest charge is tsmom +4 / flow +4 - which is what the operator had
already said they were willing to spend before the estimate was refined downward.  Under-charging is the
dangerous direction: it makes every later verdict look more significant than it is.
