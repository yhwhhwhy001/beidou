"""How much of the archive the 2026-09-13 gap fix moves, and proof it moves nothing else.

`exit_step` used to fall through its `price > 0` guard on a NaN close, re-anchoring the entry price on
the far side of the gap and turning the stop off for the segment that followed.  The fix holds the
state still on such a bar.  That is a deliberate behaviour change, so it has to be priced:

  1. which PIT members of the 1h archive carry an INTERNAL gap at all (NaN between their first and
     last observation - a listing date or a delisting is not a gap);
  2. that none of them is in the pinned live universe (`config/alpha_registry.yaml: universe`), so the
     running loop's numbers are untouched;
  3. that on a panel with no internal NaN, the pre-fix and post-fix `apply_exits` agree BIT FOR BIT
     over every bar that has a close, weights and events alike.

The carry is BOUNDED by `stale_carry_bars`, and the last block sweeps that bound.  It has to be
bounded: a symbol whose archive simply STOPS looks exactly like a symbol missing one bar at the moment
it happens, so an unbounded carry holds a delisted symbol to the end of the panel (79,447 symbol-bars
across 150 ragged tails, measured before the bound went in).  Every extra bar of patience buys back
stops that longer holes swallowed and pays for it in tail bars; the sweep prices both sides, and
`run_backtest` prices what the whole change is worth.

The pre-fix code is read out of git rather than re-typed, so (3) compares against the real baseline.
