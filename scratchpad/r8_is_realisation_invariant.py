"""Does a manual flatten still move R8's reading, now that the ruler carries unrealised P&L?

Before 2026-09-13T22:00Z the ladder read realised income only, so a flatten - which converts held
paper losses into booked ones - handed it a loss it had never seen.  Measured on the live record that
day: the 21:00Z flatten moved the reading from -0.924% to -1.754%, nearly doubling it.

The new ruler is `path + carried` where `path` carries realised income and `carried` is the unrealised
term, so realising a loss should move both by the same amount with opposite sign and leave the reading
where it was.  This builds the two worlds and asks `attributed_drawdown_state` itself rather than
trusting that algebra:

  held      the book carries an unrealised loss U and books nothing
  flattened the same book realises exactly U in the last bar and carries nothing

Same equity path, same base, same everything else.  If the ruler is realisation-invariant the two
readings are equal.
