"""R8 sizes off CURRENT equity but divides by a path anchored at the baseline.  Which way does that bias?

The ladder's reading is `marked / peak - 1`, where `peak` is the running max of `base + book P&L`.  The
positions whose loss lands in that numerator are sized as `weight x CURRENT equity`.  So the same
percentage move of the book produces a reading scaled by `equity / peak`:

    reading  =  (x% * gross)  / peak      and      gross = weight_sum * equity
    so        reading / (x% * weight_sum)  =  equity / peak

`equity / peak > 1` means the reading OVERSTATES the book's own percentage drawdown - the rung fires
EARLIER than the book's own move would suggest; `< 1` means later.  The gap moves whenever equity moves
for a reason the book did not earn, which on this account is mostly BTC collateral repricing (52.65%)
and external flows.

Uses `attributed_drawdown_state` itself on growing prefixes rather than reimplementing the path: a
second implementation of the quantity under test is how two rulers end up in one repository.
