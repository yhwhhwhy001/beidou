"""Is the rung's 785-vs-1 split between universes a structural difference, or a knife edge?

At k=0.60 the shipped first rung (-35%) is crossed on 785 pit bars and 1 static bar.  Read as a
structural fact that says the brake means something completely different depending on which universe
you believe.  But pit's worst mark-to-market drawdown is -39.85% and static's is -35.29%, so the rung
sits 0.29pp inside static's deepest point and 4.85pp inside pit's - which is the shape of a threshold
that happens to land where one curve ends, not of two different books.

This sweeps the threshold instead of reading one point, on both universes.  A knife edge shows up as
static's count collapsing across a fraction of a percentage point while pit's changes smoothly.

Replay of the shipped construction; nothing is chosen and no ledger row is written.
