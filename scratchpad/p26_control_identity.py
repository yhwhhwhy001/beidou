"""P26 CONTROL 1 broke.  This is what settled whether the harness was wrong or the control was.

The control, as pre-registered, said: at capital 0 with guards off, net Sharpe must be identical
across all seven `vol_target` values, because the backtest is scale-free.  It came out with a spread
of 0.133, and the pre-registration said that voids the run.

It does not.  The control was mis-specified, by me, and the mistake is worth keeping because it is an
easy one: the identity measured on 2026-09-04 is about scaling a FIXED weight frame by k, and changing
`vol_target` is not that operation.  `max_weight`, `max_gross` and the two no-trade bands live INSIDE
the portfolio construction and are absolute or relative thresholds that do not scale with the weights,
so a different vol target produces a differently-SHAPED path rather than a rescaled one.  Turning off
the book-guard replay does not remove them: they were already baked into the weights before
`run_backtest` ever saw the frame.

Measured here, in the order the question has to be asked:

  A. the identity as 2026-09-04 stated it - one frame, scaled - holds EXACTLY (1.8227423775 at every
     multiplier), so `run_backtest` is not the problem;
  B. vol_target 0.15 -> 0.30 takes symbol-bars pinned at the 0.15 per-symbol cap from 2,113 to 21,710
     and gross mean 0.486 -> 0.890, so the caps bind on an order of magnitude more of the panel;
  C. the ratio w(0.30)/w(0.15) is not 2.0 anywhere near everywhere - it ranges over [-1851, +1738],
     because the no-trade band makes the two paths take different rebalancing DECISIONS, so a weight
     can even sit opposite in sign between them.

Conclusion: CONTROL 1 as written could never have passed, for any correct implementation.  A is the
control it should have been, and it passes.
