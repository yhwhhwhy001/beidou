"""Turning command-line arguments into a scored-on panel - the research layer that is not a command.

A sibling module rather than a `beidou_cli.research` package, because that name is already the click
group in `beidou_cli/__init__.py` and a package would shadow it.

M6 step 1 (2026-09-17; `docs/analysis/2026-09-13-full-repo-review.md`'s M6, and layer 0 ② of
`2026-09-17-alpha-module-deep-analysis.md`).  `research_cmd.py` had grown to 3,500 lines holding nine
commands, their click plumbing and every helper all three of those need; this is the first seam taken
out of it, and it is chosen rather than convenient.

**Why this seam first, measured.**  Twenty-nine scripts under `scratchpad/` - the reproductions behind
D-035's ladder bootstrap, P26, P29, P32, D-039's band sweep and the exit reachability tables - open
with `from beidou_cli.research_cmd import _load, _membership, _resolve_symbols`.  That is the evidence
base of this repository importing three private functions out of a CLI module, and it is the concrete
form of what the analysis recorded as "reproducing a validation report means importing CLI privates".
Splitting the nine COMMANDS apart would not have touched it; this layer is what those scripts actually
want, and it is the same layer the sink step moves again, out of `beidou_cli` altogether.

**Nothing moves twice without saying so.**  `research_cmd` re-exports every name below, so the
twenty-nine scripts, the tests and any branch in flight keep working unchanged.  That shim is
temporary by design: when `evaluate_book` sinks into `beidou_alpha.validation`, these go with it and
the scripts get a home that is not a command-line tool.  Until then a re-export is the honest state -
the code has one definition and two addresses, which is a different thing from having two copies.

    Loading them means reading a parquet per symbol and aligning every bucket, which is real work for a
    run whose signals read none of it - and the alignment is where the only look-ahead in this data
    lives, so a run that does not need the columns is better off not carrying them at all.  Callers
    turn them on when a strategy declares `needs_metrics` / `needs_spot`, and `research mine` turns both
    on always, because the candidates it is about to enumerate are exactly what decides the answer.

    ``spot`` was the missing half of DL-D5 until 2026-09-09 and the shape of the miss is worth keeping:
    every part of the spot path existed - the store, the ingest command, the alignment contract, the
    `basis` leaf, `load_panel`'s own `spot_store` parameter, and `mine`'s narrowing on
    `Panel.spot_symbols` - and nothing built the store here, so `spot_symbols` was 0 on every panel this
    module could construct and the narrowing switched the family off on every run.  Eighteen shapes,
    zero enumerated, and the artefact said `include_basis: false` truthfully.  That is the same defect
    DL-D4 had one feed over, arriving through the panel rather than through the flag.

    What is still NOT wired, named rather than left for the next reader to discover: `backtest`, `book`,
    `diagnose`, `correlate` and `overlay` pass neither `metrics` nor `spot`, so a mined `oi`, `lsr` or
    `basis` candidate that survives `validate` cannot yet be run through them.  One predicate per site
    fixes it; it is a separate change because it is the metrics feed's gap too and the two should move
    together rather than leave the pipeline half-asymmetric in a new place.
