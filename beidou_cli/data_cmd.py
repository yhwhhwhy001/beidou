    it from the name - which gets 1000SATSUSDT and three others wrong, silently and by a factor of 1000.

    series ("same grid, no offset, right multiplier"), and a claim that is only tested against fixtures
    is a claim about the fixtures; this is the one place both real series are on disk together.

    So is the OTHER check, and the two answer different questions about the same pair of markets.
    ``measure_alignment`` asks whether this perpetual is paired with the right spot symbol at the right
    unit - a per-symbol question about the mapping.  ``verify_spot_contract`` asks whether the spot
    feed's own two sources agree about what their timestamps MEAN - one question about the feed, which
    is RISK-G3's, and the one `beidou_live.engine.spot_refusal` holds a basis strategy to.  Both run
    here because this command is the only place that has the archive and REST open at once; the second
