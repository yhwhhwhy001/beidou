    a search that costs nothing is a DSR denominator that is wrong in the one direction that flatters

    hand.  Rows fold only on the full signature, data range included, so re-running the same space
    after the range has moved is recorded as a new trial per candidate: conservative charging, KILL-Q5.
    Measured 2026-09-08: P20's 514-wide space re-run over 24 more bars appended 514 rows and the
    family's prior went 514 -> 1,028; the operator then ruled those rows back out, which is a
    governance call this command does not make.  The last lines, and the report's ``ledger`` block,
    say what this run charged and what the family now costs, so the number is seen where it is
