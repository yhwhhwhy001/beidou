    level down: a search that costs nothing is a DSR denominator wrong in the direction that flatters it.

    The rows carry **no construction or overlay digest and no Sharpe**, and neither omission is laziness.
    The pair search runs on `panel.close` before any weight exists, so it enumerates the identical

    candidates were never scored one at a time (they are selected on formation-window correlation, not
    on their own P&L), and `dsr_inputs` pools only rows that have one: the census moves N and leaves the
    Sharpe dispersion to the configurations that really were scored.  `mine` already writes None-Sharpe
    rows for its never-traded candidates, so this is the established shape rather than a new one.
