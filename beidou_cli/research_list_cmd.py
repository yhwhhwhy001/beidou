# The panel layer now lives in `beidou_cli/research_panel.py` (M6 step 1) and is re-exported here.
# Twenty-nine scripts under `scratchpad/` - the reproductions behind D-035's ladder bootstrap, P26,
# P29, P32, D-039's band sweep and the exit reachability tables - import `_load`, `_membership` and
# `_resolve_symbols` from THIS module, and a dozen tests import the others.  Moving the definitions
# without keeping the addresses would have made a move-only commit break the evidence base, so the
# addresses stay until the sink step gives those names a home outside `beidou_cli` entirely.
