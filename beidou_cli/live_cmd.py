    Two of them, found one at a time and the same shape both times.

    `universe.json` lives under the DATA root, which neither `--state-dir` nor `--paper` isolates, and
    every enabled strategy's cited evidence records the universe fingerprint it was produced under.
    Refreshing it therefore invalidates the ARMED loop's evidence, and `registry_dataset_problems`
    then refuses its next start.

    Measured on 2026-09-08: a shadow started at 18:00Z re-ranked the pool, the fingerprint moved
    d47dbc7c -> 788ade10, and an armed restart went from clean to blocked.  The armed loop refreshes
    daily at about 01:00Z on its own, so restartability was going to expire that night anyway - the
    shadow brought it forward by seven hours, which is the whole harm and is also exactly enough to
    matter during an incident.

    The first version of this guard named `--state-dir` and `--registry`, because a canary was what
    had just done it.  A bare `--paper` was not covered and did it again at 18:00Z the same day,
    swapping CYSUSDT -> PUMPUSDT in the shared file; the universe pin proposed the next morning was
    built from that file and named a symbol the armed loop had never held.  The condition was never
    the flag - it is whether this process is the one trading the account.

    A shadow wants the universe the armed loop is holding, not a fresh opinion about it, so this is
    what the check is FOR rather than a limitation of it.  `--symbols` is how a person says otherwise,
    deliberately and in the shell history.

    The SECOND record is `metrics_snapshot`, found 2026-09-09 while about to start the L3 paper soak.
    `MetricsStore.append` is read-modify-write through one `.parquet.tmp` per symbol, so two writers
    do not merely lose rows - they can publish a file one of them was still writing.  And DL-Q6 says
    that store is "the metrics the loop could read", meaning the ARMED loop: a paper process adding
    rows to it makes the parity check (M-011) compare the live decision against data no live decision
    was made on.  A shadow still READS it - coverage gating needs that the moment a metrics-using
    strategy is enabled - it just does not write.
