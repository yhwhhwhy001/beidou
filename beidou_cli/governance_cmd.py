    §3 says a probe may only reach main if it still clears the recomputed one.  That condition had no

    "searching more retires your own incumbents".

    is what folds events into `governance_state.json` - this command hands it the reading through

    `lifecycle.apply` had no production caller at all; that was true in the branch this command was

    `consecutive_probe_stops` and R7's `probe_entries` were typed numbers.  `governance tenure`
    already derived the events from `cycles.jsonl`; nothing folded them anywhere.

    **Idempotence is the whole difficulty**, and worth naming precisely, because the counter usually
    cited is not the one at risk here.  R7's `probe_entries` moves on `queued -> probe`, and no event
    this command derives produces that edge - it is `governance apply`'s.  What a second fold of the
    same record moves is `windows_survived`, which would reach main in four and a half windows instead
    of §3's nine, and `consecutive_probe_stops`, where one stop counted twice is R5's two and freezes
    promotion for six windows.  R7 is then reachable at one remove: a probe demoted by a stop it only
    took once spends a life when it is promoted back.  It is held by a per-candidate watermark
    (`folded_through`) that
    stores the instant of the last event absorbed - state, not derivation, because the derivation is
    deliberately stateless and re-reads the whole record every run.  Note which half is which: the
    events are re-derived every time, including the ones already folded, and only the FOLD is skipped.
    That is why a stop still ends a tenure on a second run even though it is not applied again.

    This never touches the registry, so it never changes what the loop trades.  A `probe -> main` here
