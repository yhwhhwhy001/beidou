把它和枚举/选格放在一起，是为了让「这次要花多少笔」只有一个地方能回答。

    Round 7's副产品 1, made addressable.  `best_params` is the full-sample argmax and is what the
    registry's startup gate compares against, so a candidate chosen by a rule that is not "highest
    full-sample Sharpe" - H-001's was "OOS >= baseline - 0.05 AND drawdown improves AND turnover
    falls" - could not be reported by the run that evaluated it.  The workaround was a second,
    single-configuration report.

    `--prereg` is required rather than encouraged, and that is the whole safeguard: naming a cell
    after seeing the grid is the selection D-028 exists to deflate, while naming one from a commit
    that predates the run is the pre-registration DL-K3 asks for - and `_preregistration` records the
    commit's own timestamp, so the ordering stays checkable from the artefact afterwards.
