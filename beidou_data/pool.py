"""Trading pool: point-in-time membership for research and a daily refresh for the live loop (D-013, D-014).

Research side.  ``point_in_time_membership`` rebuilds "the top-N by trailing
quote volume *as it stood at the time*" from daily klines of every symbol
that ever had an archive, so backtests do not trade 2021 with the 2026
universe.  Live side.  ``LivePool`` re-ranks candidates once a day with the
same hysteresis; the engine flattens what leaves and lets ``min_history_bars``
keep new listings untraded until they have a month of bars.
