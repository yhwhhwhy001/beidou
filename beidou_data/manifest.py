"""A digest of the data a result was computed from (recovered from V2's dataset manifest / PIT lineage).

Everything else in this system already names itself: a validation report carries a digest, the registry
carries a signal fingerprint, a live cycle carries a construction fingerprint.  The *data* did not, and on
2026-09-04 that gap bit: the point-in-time membership table was rebuilt from monthly to daily at 13:20
while `config/live.demo.yaml` still described it as monthly, and P12 was written against the stale
description.  Nothing was wrong with either the table or the comment on its own - what was missing was
anything that would notice they had stopped agreeing.

Deliberately cheap.  It reads sizes, row counts and boundary timestamps from the parquet footers and the
small JSON files; it does not hash bar contents, because a manifest nobody runs is worth nothing and
hashing a 435 KB membership table plus 879 symbol files on every report would make it optional in
practice.  That is a stated limit, not an oversight: this detects *replacement and drift*, not silent
in-place corruption of individual bars.

    ``.beidou/data/universe.json`` is rewritten by the live loop's own universe refresh, so a
    ``pool-refresh -> live-refresh`` transition is the loop's bookkeeping and not evidence going stale.
    Measured 2026-09-04: tsmom's cited universe read ``pool-refresh``/15 against ``live-refresh``/16 on
    disk, so treating every universe move as drift would have the loop refuse to start because of
    something it did itself.  A symbol set that moves while the source holds still is the real thing -
    the book being traded is no longer the book the evidence describes.

    2026-09-15: ``universe_mode == "pit"`` exempts the field outright.  ``_resolve_symbols`` calls
    ``read_universe`` only under ``static``, so a pit VALIDATION or MINE result's population is the
    union of ``membership.parquet``, which blocks unconditionally one field over.  Blocking such a
    result here refuses a start over a file it never opened - and the fix shipped for that on
    2026-09-09 was to freeze the TRADED pool instead, which held the live universe at 16 names while
    the cited evidence re-ranked every 24 hours.  Only an EXPLICIT ``pit`` is exempt: a report that
    declares no mode keeps its block.

    Narrowed from "a pit result" to those two commands on 2026-09-15, because the first wording was
    not true of every pit report and this repository reads these paragraphs as fact.  ``research book
    --universe pit --robustness static`` DOES read ``universe.json`` (``research_cmd.py:2470``) to
    build its sensitivity arm, and the shipped registry cites exactly such a report -
    ``book-tsmom-flow-20260908T105322Z.json``, ``universe_mode: "pit"`` with
    ``robustness_universe: "static"``.  It is harmless today only because ``book`` writes no
    ``dataset`` block (``build_manifest`` is called by ``validate`` and ``mine`` alone), so that
    report reaches ``manifest_check`` as ``None`` and never reaches this predicate at all.  Give
    ``book`` a manifest and this exemption starts waving through a report that did read the file.
