"""Daily metrics archive downloader, with resume and checksum verification (DL-D2 / DL-Q6).

Deliberately shaped like ``archive.py``: verify the zip against its published checksum, treat 404 as
"not published yet" rather than as an error, and let the STORE be the watermark so a resume needs no
side file to go stale.  That module learned these three things once; a second downloader should not
have to learn them again.

The publication schedule, measured 2026-09-07: a day's file appears at about T+1 06:45-07:00 UTC
(three consecutive days landed at 06:58, 06:52 and 06:43).  So "today" and usually "yesterday morning"
are legitimately absent, and a sync that treated absence as failure would be red every morning.

Every frame leaves here in the canonical shape of ``beidou_data.metrics`` - ``open_time``, never
``create_time`` - because the whole point of that module is that the conversion happens exactly once.

    ``workers`` fetches several SYMBOLS at once.  By symbol rather than by day for two reasons that

    happens on this thread, in the loop below, so two workers can never touch one parquet.  Measured
    per symbol-day: 0.06s of CPU against 0.58s of waiting, so this is the axis with the headroom.
