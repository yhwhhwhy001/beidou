"""The loop's own metrics recording: one truth for research and live (DL-Q6 / KILL-Q11).

KILL-Q11's finding is that research and live read *different sources* - the T+1 daily archive and the
30-day REST window - so a metrics signal validated on one and traded on the other has never been
tested on what it will actually see.  The archive/REST stamp offset showed how quietly that goes
wrong: the same numbers under two conventions, and a five-minute look-ahead in every bucket.

The answer is not a second copy of the data, it is a recording of *what the loop could read*.  The
loop polls the REST window each cycle and appends the buckets to its own store; that store is the
common truth, and the archive becomes something to CHECK it against rather than something to trade on.

**No separate five-minute daemon**, and the reasoning matters more than the code.  The granularity
that matters belongs to the BUCKET (5m), not to the poll: the REST window is 30 days deep, so one
poll an hour retrieves all twelve buckets of the past hour with nothing missed.  Polling at the bar
close also does something a 5m daemon cannot - it records exactly the buckets that had CLOSED when the
loop made its decision, which is precisely the set `align_to_bars` selects.  A daemon would be a
second process, a second failure mode and a second thing to restart, in exchange for a superset of the
same rows recorded at instants no decision was made at.
