"""Binance SPOT klines beside the USDⓈ-M perpetual ones, and the contract that makes the two comparable (DL-D5).

Everything below was MEASURED against the venue on 2026-09-09, not inferred from the naming, because
DL-D2 is the record of what inferring costs: metrics' archive stamp turned out to be one bucket earlier
than REST's, nothing raised, and every piece of evidence would have carried five minutes of look-ahead.
Spot-vs-perp is the same shape one market over, so it gets the same treatment.

1.  COVERAGE.  362 of the 528 TRADING USDT perpetuals have a TRADING spot symbol; 166 do not.  A third
    of the board has no spot leg at all, so "missing" is the common case rather than the exception, and
    a pipeline that cannot say so honestly is worse than no pipeline.

2.  THE NAME IS NOT A RULE.  Six perps quote a multiple of the spot unit - 1000BONK, 1000FLOKI,
    1000LUNC, 1000PEPE, 1000SHIB, 1000XEC - so their price is 1000x the spot price.  But 1000CATUSDT,
    1000CHEEMSUSDT, 1000SATSUSDT and 1MBABYDOGEUSDT are listed on SPOT under those exact names: the
    TOKEN is called 1000SATS, and stripping the digits would name a different asset (or, as here, one
    the venue does not list).  So a candidate is PROPOSED from the name and CONFIRMED against the
    venue's own listing, identity first.  A pure string rule gets four symbols wrong today and would
    get them wrong silently - a 1000x price error reads as a 100,000% basis, not as an exception.

3.  THE GRID.  Both markets stamp ``open_time`` on the same UTC hour boundary: every bar of 2026-08,
    in both markets, satisfies ``open_time % 3_600_000 == 0``.

4.  ARCHIVE VS REST, for spot.  744/744 bars of BTCUSDT 2026-08 have identical closes when the archive's
    ``open_time`` is joined to REST's ``openTime`` directly; 0/743 at a one-bar shift either way.  So
    there is NO offset here - the opposite of what DL-D2 found for metrics.  That is precisely why it
    had to be measured: "no offset" and "one bucket of offset" look the same in code.

5.  UNITS.  The spot monthly archive switched from milliseconds to MICROSECONDS at 2025-01 (BTCUSDT
    1h: 1717200000000 in 2024-06, 1735689600000000 in 2025-01); the futures archive is still
    milliseconds in 2026-08.  ``klines_to_frame`` normalises both, which is the only reason a spot
    ingest can reuse it - reading a microsecond stamp as milliseconds puts the bar tens of thousands of
    years out, the join to the perp index then matches nothing, and a column of NaN looks exactly like
    a symbol nobody downloaded.

6.  THE LAG.  For BTCUSDT, SOLUSDT, 1000SHIBUSDT and 1000PEPEUSDT over 2026-08, the lag minimising
    ``median |log(perp_close / (spot_close * multiplier))|`` is 0 bars, at 0.00043-0.00151 against
    0.0015-0.0039 one bar either side.  This is the spot analogue of DL-D2's 166/166, and
    ``measure_alignment`` is it as a runnable check rather than a sentence in a log.

7.  WHY THERE IS NO FORWARD FILL.  XMRUSDT's spot listing has been halted since 2024-02-20 02:00 (last
    bar, close 118.70) while its perpetual trades normally (2026-09-09 07:00, close 503.83).  Under the
    "latest bucket that had closed" rule ``metrics.align_to_bars`` uses - correct there, for open
    interest - a basis leaf would read +324% and hold it for two years.  It would look like the trade of
    the decade and it is an artefact of a dead listing.  So a perp bar reads the spot bar with the SAME
    open time or it reads NaN.  Same grid, so same-bar costs nothing; a hole stays a hole.

8.  PAGE SIZE.  ``/api/v3/klines?limit=1500`` returns HTTP 200 and 1000 rows - it does not error, it
    truncates.  ``klines_range`` decides "was that a full page?" by comparing against the page limit, so
    a spot client inheriting the futures 1500 would read one page, conclude the range was exhausted and
    stop 1000 bars in, quietly.  Hence ``_page_limit`` is per client rather than a module constant.

9.  ABSENCE.  A perp with no spot listing answers 400 ``-1121 Invalid symbol`` on REST and 404 on the
    archive.  Neither is a failure and neither may end a run.
