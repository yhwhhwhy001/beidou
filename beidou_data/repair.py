"""`beidou data repair`: ask the sources once for every hole in the stored archive (9.4, 2026-09-25).

`KlineStore.gaps` has found holes since 2026-09-04 (T-D01) and nothing mended them.  GRTUSDT's 120 bars
came back from a one-off REST call; every other hole stayed one, and a backtest reads a hole as a jump.
A hole is one of two things and only the sources can say which.  Either they hold the rows and a sync
lost them - the monthly files lack 2022-02-26..28 and 2022-04-01..02, REST filled those days for the 146
members of 2026-09-03's table, and eighteen symbols still carry both holes, three of them members of
today's - or they do not, and the hole is a fact about the market: a contract relisted under an old
name, a redenomination halt.

So each hole is asked for once, in the order `beidou data sync` trusts its sources: the daily archive
files that cover it (checksummed, like the monthly ones), then REST for whatever they left.  Only rows
strictly inside the hole are merged, through the store's own ``append``.  A stored row is never
rewritten, so the dedupe rule has nothing to decide and the sync's watermark does not move.  A source
whose rows disagree with a stored row it overlaps is not used at all - it may be a different series
under the same name.  What no source holds goes into ``confirmed_gaps.json`` beside the data: `data
status` stops reporting it, and research can tell a confirmed absence from a sync that never finished.

Nothing here fills a price.  No interpolation, no forward fill.  A hole the sources do not have stays a
hole, and the record says who was asked and what they answered.
