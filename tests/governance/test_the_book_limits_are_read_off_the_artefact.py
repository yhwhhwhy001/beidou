"""`validated -> booked` has four conditions; three of them were a literal `True` until today.

`beidou_governance/replay.py` built its `Facts` for a book report with `slippage_stress_pass=True`,
`max_correlation_with_running=0.0` and `turnover_ratio_to_main=0.0` - the passing value of every one -
and listed them as suspended.  That was honest about the blind spot and it also meant the state
machine's own comment ("Absent knowledge is False, never assumed true") described nothing that ran:
the only condition an artefact could fail at this transition was D-018's verdict.

These tests hold the three properties the fix has to have, and the third is the one that is easy to
get wrong: a report that carries the block must be JUDGED on it, a report that does not must be
SUSPENDED, and a value of `null` inside the block must suspend rather than read as 0.0 - because 0.0
is the passing value for both of the numeric limits, so "nobody measured it" and "it correlates with
nothing" would otherwise be spelled the same way.
