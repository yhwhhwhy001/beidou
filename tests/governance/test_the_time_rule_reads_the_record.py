"""T-G6′: the time rule's events, derived from `cycles.jsonl` instead of typed by a person.

`lifecycle.py` shipped knowing what `WINDOW_SURVIVED` and `PNL_STOP` mean and nothing produced
either, so the state machine was complete and unreachable: no probe could reach main and no main
sleeve could be sent back without somebody asserting the event by hand -- the one thing §3's "all
machine-driven" was written to remove.

These tests are about the derivation only.  What the events then DO is `lifecycle`'s, and
`test_the_rules_hold_over_any_sequence.py` already holds that end.
