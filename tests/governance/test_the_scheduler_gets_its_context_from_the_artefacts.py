"""`governance next`: DL-G8's decision function, given something to decide about.

`scheduler.next_action` was written, tested and unreachable - it and `budget` were both in the module
reachability guard's EXEMPT list, 227 lines holding R1 and the whole research pipeline order that no
command could run.  The assembler is what makes AC-G8 attemptable at all.

These tests drive the COMMAND rather than `assemble`, deliberately.  The defect this repository kept
finding all week is a control with no caller, and on 2026-09-09 it arrived inside the fix for itself:
`governance canary` was added to give `canary.evaluate` a caller and shipped broken, because the test
exercised the module and not the command.  A test that imports `assemble` and never types the command
name reproduces exactly that.

The load-bearing test is the third one.  Every count in `Context` has a `> 0` branch, so a field that
could not be read and is defaulted to 0 does not fail - it answers, confidently, one step further down
the pipeline than the evidence supports.
