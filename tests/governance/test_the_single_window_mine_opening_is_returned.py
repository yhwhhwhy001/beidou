"""0.3.1 opened one extra mine round for one window.  This is what makes "one window" a fact.

The operator ruled a fifth round on 2026-09-10, for a window that allows four, because the 09-09 round
raced the spot ingest and never enumerated the 18 basis shapes.  The ruling was explicitly not a
standing increase - and a "just this once" recorded only in prose is a promise, which is precisely the
category the 2026-09-09 audit spent a day separating from controls.

So the reversion has an executing check.  From `SINGLE_WINDOW_MINE_OPENING_ENDS` this test fails, every
run, until somebody sets `max_mine_rounds_per_window` back to `STANDING_MINE_ROUNDS`.  It is meant to
be a nuisance on exactly one day and invisible before it: a test that can only fail in the future is
still a control, and one that never fails is the thing being guarded against.

Deliberately not a warning, a log line or a comment.  Each of those was available and each is what the
audit kept finding in place of a gate.

2026-09-25: the check did its job before its day.  Asked about the date ahead of it, the operator
made the fifth round standing, so `STANDING_MINE_ROUNDS` moved 4 -> 5 and the number stayed 5.  From
2026-10-03 the first test below holds because the standing value moved, not because the round was
returned - the second of the two paths its own message names.  Why no `POLICY_VERSION` bump: see there.
