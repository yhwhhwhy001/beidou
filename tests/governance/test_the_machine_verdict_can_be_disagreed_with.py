"""M-G05, which was Pre-A′'s only falsifier and had no instrument of any kind until 2026-09-10.

The plan names Pre-A′ - "写死的规则能替代人在运行时的**决策**" - as its highest-risk assumption, gives
it exactly one falsifier (M-G05, divergence between machine rulings and later human review), and then
never writes, reads or computes it.  §11 had the row, §13 had the cell, `governance/` had neither.

Two properties this file exists to hold, because both are ways the measurement quietly stops measuring:

* the sample is written BY THE GATE, so it is not selected by which decisions somebody found memorable;
* an unreviewed ruling is `pending`, not absent, so the denominator cannot shrink toward agreement.
