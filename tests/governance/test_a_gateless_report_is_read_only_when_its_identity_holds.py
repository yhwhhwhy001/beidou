"""Operator ruling 2026-09-14 (Q1): a pre-`gate` report may be recomputed, but only if it proves its rule.

KILL-Q3 put `gate` into `oos_selection` so a stored threshold could not outlive the rule that made it,
and `read_gate` refuses any block that does not carry it.  That refusal is correct and it is also
total: all seven mined validation reports predate the field, so the production recheck has no opinion
about any of them - including `mined_594a12f9307a15d9`, the only candidate this pipeline has ever
passed, whose admissibility is the subject of an open ruling.

The operator's ruling is that the identity may stand in for the label, and the reason it may is that
the identity is FALSIFIABLE.  `threshold_annual` is the raw quantile times `sqrt(bars_per_year)`, so
`threshold_annual / max_sharpe_quantile(n, variance, alpha)` recovers the annualisation - and if the
threshold had been produced by any other rule, that ratio is not `sqrt(bars_per_year)`.

Measured on the seven, before the rule was written:

    594a12f9  1h  implied 93.594872  =  sqrt(8760) to 0.000e+00   <- the quantile rule
    three 1h  1h  implied 75.362971  =  0.8052 x sqrt(8760)
    three 1d  1d  implied 15.317012  =  0.8017 x sqrt(365)

~0.805 is `E[max] / quantile(0.95)`: those six were written under the EXPECTATION, which is what
KILL-Q3 replaced because it "admitted pure noise at 43.5%".  So the check does not wave the seven
through - it admits the one report that was produced under today's rule and refuses the six that were
not, which is precisely the discrimination the `gate` field exists to make.  Recovering it from the
numbers is only possible because the alternative rule leaves a different fingerprint.
