"""DL-K3 compared two ISO timestamps as STRINGS, and that is not the rule it was meant to be.

`git` writes `preregistration.committed_at` with the COMMITTER's local offset; a report writes
`generated_at` in UTC.  The two are routinely in different zones, so `a < b` on the text was
answering a question about spelling.

It failed both ways.  Measured 2026-09-09 on the pointer the live registry cites, it REFUSED valid
evidence.  Turn the offset around and it ACCEPTS a forgery - and that is the direction that matters,
because DL-K3 exists to stop a result being registered after it is already known.
