"""The research loop had no reason to ever stop mining, and by 2026-09-09 it should have.

`next_action` returns MINE whenever R2's condition holds (the space digest moved) and R1 still has a
round.  Nothing in it looks at whether another round could produce an admissible candidate.  It could
not, and had not been able to for days: the `mined` bucket's D-028 threshold rises monotonically with
N, and by 2026-09-09 it had risen past the out-of-sample Sharpe of the best candidate the space has
ever produced.  Two more rounds ran after that.

The condition here is DERIVED, not chosen - which is the only reason it may live in a scheduler that
otherwise holds no thresholds of its own (`test_policy_is_the_only_place_a_threshold_lives`).  Both
sides of it are measurements already on disk:

* the best mined candidate's own `oos_selection` block, from its validation report;
* the ledger today.

The recomputation itself is `family_gate.read_gate` and deliberately not a second implementation of
it.  The first version of this file asserted against one, and it was wrong exactly where that module's
comment says a second implementation goes wrong: it read N as the bucket count, while `dsr_inputs`
builds N as `ledger_trials + grid + declared prior`.  `mined_594a12f9307a15d9` was signed at
575 = 0 + 1 + 574, so its N today is 575 plus the bucket's growth - understating the gate by 0.02 and
stopping later than it should.

It refuses SPENDING, never promotion.  Nothing here touches a verdict, `n_trials`, or what may reach
the book; an append-only ledger makes not-spending the reversible direction, and mining resumes by
itself the moment a wider space or a better candidate moves either number.
