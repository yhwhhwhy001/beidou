"""AC-G6': the real engine produces the record, and the real time rule reads it back.

Both halves were already tested and they never met.  `tests/live/test_probe.py` drives a live engine
until a probe book's stop fires; `tests/governance/test_the_time_rule_reads_the_record.py` drives
`tenure` over hand-written cycles.  Between them sits the join AC-G6' is actually about - whether the
rows the engine WRITES are the rows the rule can READ - and that join is where this project's defects
live: `probes_from_registry` excluding the main book, the record keyed on the book while the state was
keyed on the strategy, a stop threshold in no digest.  A hand-written fixture agrees with whatever it
was written to agree with.

So: run the engine, let the stop fire, hand `tenure` the file the engine just wrote, and assert the
state machine moves the way §3 says.  Three sequences, which is what AC-G6' asks for.
