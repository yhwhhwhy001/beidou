"""DRILL-G2 and DRILL-G6, the two of §5's six that were still owed.

The other four are drills already: G1 writes a bad evidence pointer at the real startup gate, G4 fails
a canary soak, G5 proposes what the file already says, G3 is the pinned `policy_digest()` plus the
comparison `live status --check` now makes.  These two were listed as "covered by the property tests",
which is not the same claim: a property test drives the state machine directly, and what these two ask
is whether the LIVE RECORD, read the way the machine reads it, produces the event at all.  That seam -
`cycles.jsonl` -> `tenure` -> `lifecycle` -> `governance_state.json` - is where the "the rule exists
and nothing raises its event" defect lives, and it is exactly the defect this project keeps finding.

G2: two stopped probes freeze promotion, and `governance status` says so; a stop on a re-baselined
    cycle is not one of the two.
G6: an hour of proxy 503s produces no governance decision at all - not a survived window, not a stop,
    not an R5 count - and does not page once per cycle.
