"""flow's gate is UNREADABLE, and the ruling of 2026-09-10 is that this already blocks it - proven here.

`governance gate` reads flow as UNREADABLE: its evidence report carries no `oos_selection` block, so
the D-028 quantile gate cannot be recomputed at today's bucket size at all.  tsmom's report has one and
reads PASS.  The obvious temptations are to treat "cannot ask" as "no objection", or to backfill the
block by re-running flow's validation - which would charge the ledger and raise the whole family's bar,
twenty-one months before the question is due.

Neither is needed, because absent knowledge is already False in both places it has to be:

* `GateReading.passes` is True only for PASS, so UNREADABLE and FAIL are alike to every caller.
* `Facts.family_gate_still_passes` defaults to False, and `governance advance` sets it from exactly
  that property, so an unreadable strategy reaches `lifecycle.apply` with the fact absent.

This file is the control that says so.  Writing "it is blocked" in a document is what §3's third
condition had instead of a branch for the eight months before 2026-09-09; the point of the whole audit
is that a claim with no executing check is not a control.

**The obligation, dated.**  flow's ninth surviving window is 2027-06.  Before then its evidence has to
carry an `oos_selection` block written under the gate in force - `research validate` produces one - or
flow cannot leave probe.  That is a deadline for the operator, not a defect: nothing is broken today,
and the loop is refusing in the safe direction.
