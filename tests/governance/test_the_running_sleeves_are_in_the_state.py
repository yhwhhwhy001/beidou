"""KILL-AR-06's grandfather, written down -- because an empty book PERMITS, it does not refuse.

`state.py` says an unreadable state is an empty book, and that this is safe because "an empty book has
no probes, so every rule that could act on it refuses for want of a candidate".  That is true only of
the candidate being evaluated.  Every rule that reads the book for CONSTRAINTS reads an empty one as
headroom: `len(book.probes)` is 0 against R3's 2, and `book.probe_fraction` is 0.0 against the 1/3
cap.  Measured 2026-09-09 with no state file on the trading machine: a second 1/3 probe was ALLOWED
on top of the flow probe that was already running live -- 2/3 of the book against a 1/3 cap, and no
rule anywhere would have said a word.

So the two sleeves the plan grandfathered have to be IN the state, not merely true of the world.
