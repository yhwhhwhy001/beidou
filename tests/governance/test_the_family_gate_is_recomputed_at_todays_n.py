"""§3's third condition on `probe -> main`, which had no branch and no producer until 2026-09-09.

`Event.FAMILY_GATE_FAILED` was defined in `lifecycle`, handled in `lifecycle`, and emitted by nothing
anywhere in the tree; the `WINDOW_SURVIVED` branch checked R4 and stopped.  So a probe reached main on
two of the three conditions §3 names, and the missing one is the only one that can turn against a
sleeve while the sleeve does nothing at all.

The mechanism, because it is the point: the D-028 gate is `max_sharpe_quantile(N, variance, alpha)`,
and N is the strategy's ledger bucket plus that run's grid plus its declared pre-ledger trials.  The
ledger term is append-only and grows whenever anybody searches in the family.  Searching more retires
your own incumbents - the gate rises as sqrt(2 ln N), so it saturates and an incumbent with margin
survives, but one adopted on a thin margin does not get to keep it by standing still.
