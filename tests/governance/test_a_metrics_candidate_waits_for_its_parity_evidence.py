"""T-D4-2 / M-011: a candidate that reads a metrics column may not reach the queue on an unproven column.

Research eats a T+1 daily archive; the live loop can only read a 30-day REST window.  The two carry
the same numbers under different stamps, and the whole same-source contract is one question - do they
agree on the buckets they share?  `metrics_parity` has answered it since DL-D2 and, until DL-D4,
nothing called it.

The obligation is to have SHOWN parity.  A missing report, an unmeasurable one, and a symbol with no
overlapping buckets are all "no" - not "not yet disproved" - because the failure mode they share is a
snapshot stream that stopped recording, which looks healthiest exactly when it is most broken.
