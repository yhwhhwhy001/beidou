"""The general form of the defect this repository found five times on 2026-09-09.

Each one was the same shape: a rule written down, versioned, hashed into a digest, recorded every
cycle - and consulted by nothing.  The shared universe, the shared metrics file, the inert registry
pin, DL-K3's string compare, the probe stop that was in no digest, and then `Policy.throttle_scalar`
and `drawdown_grace_cycles` with no caller anywhere in the tree.

`policy_digest()` hashes every field of `Policy`, which is a promise: change one and the change is
visible in the record.  For a field nothing reads, that promise is worse than absent - the digest
moves, the operator sees a rule version bump, and the machine's behaviour is identical.  A threshold
that looks live and is dead.

So: every field of `Policy` must be reachable from production code, either by name or through a method
of `Policy` that production calls.  Making a field unreachable is still allowed - the fix is to delete
it, because a constant nothing reads belongs in prose, not in a hashed policy.
