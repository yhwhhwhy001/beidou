"""`governance plan` is a dry run and it was recording a machine ruling into M-G05's ledger.

`plan`'s own docstring: "What `apply` would do, without doing it - the gate is asked against a copy."
It then called `_log_admission`, so every rehearsal landed a `pending` row in
`governance/verdicts.jsonl` - the sample M-G05 divides by, and Pre-A′'s only falsifier.

Measured 2026-09-12, during the DRILL-G1 production run: four `plan`/`apply` invocations within four
minutes left four rows, three of them rehearsals, and `governance divergence` went from 1 pending to 5.
Ten quiet rehearsals reach the quorum of 10 with no decision having been made.

This is the SAME defect found the same morning on the other gate (`family_gate` keyed idempotence on
the date, so one `governance gate` a day was one sample a day).  Two gates, one command apart, the same
question - "is a re-asking a new answer?" - answered wrong both times.
