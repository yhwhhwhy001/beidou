"""R1 and the state file: the two things `lifecycle`'s pure functions deliberately do not know.

R3/R4/R5/R7 are properties of the book's state, so they live in the state machine.  R1 is a property
of the trials ledger, which is append-only and shared between parallel sessions - a counter held in
memory would already be wrong by the time a second session's `research validate` returned, and the
2026-09-08 incident was exactly that shape: a search charging 514 rows with nothing saying so.

The state file's job is narrower than it looks.  It does not decide anything; it lets the deciding
survive a restart, which matters because a restart is the ONLY moment the construction can change and
therefore the moment the machine is most likely to be asked a question it half-remembers.
