"""§8's Phase 4a presumes a list of construction changes applied together, and the list never existed.

"块 4 必改项**一次改完** → 重启 → 攒 30 天干净窗口" only makes sense if something holds what "必改项"
are.  Each was decided in a log entry; the log has no reader; so on the day a window opens nothing tells
anybody what it was supposed to carry.  Same shape as the thirteen reopen conditions found on
2026-09-10, pointed the other way - not a closed hypothesis nobody reopens, but an open decision nobody
applies.

The concrete cost, measured 2026-09-12: the probe stop's caliber was ruled, recalibrated, and all four
falsifiers passed, and it cannot ship because `max_loss` is inside `construction_fingerprint`.  Without
this list, "what to apply, with which measured values, and why it waited" would be one log entry among
thirty by the time 2026-10-03 arrives.
