"""Phase 0 item B: R0-R10 over synthetic event sequences, not over the one history we have.

The replay (item A) answers "do the rules reproduce what happened".  It cannot answer "can the rules
be made to do something forbidden", because history only contains the sequences a careful person
actually produced.  These properties answer that: hypothesis drives arbitrary events at the state
machine and asserts the invariants that make autonomous promotion survivable.

The invariants are the ones whose failure is expensive rather than the ones that are easy to state.
R3's two probe slots and 1/3 budget bound what a wrong rule can cost; R5's freeze and R7's three
lives bound how long it can keep costing it; RETIRED being absorbing is what stops a demotion loop,
which is the failure the operator explicitly asked to be protected against.

AC-G3 says "R0-R10, zero violations over 1,000 sequences", and this file must not be read as making
that claim whole: only R3/R4/R5/R7 and the no-decision rule are properties OF A SEQUENCE of events.
The others are not, and each is held somewhere a sequence cannot reach - R0 by the gate the report
carries (`quantile_gate_pass` here is an input, not the rule), R1/R2 by the ledger and space digest in
`budget.py` and its tests, R6 by the rollback drill, R8 by
`tests/live/test_the_ladder_reads_attributed_pnl_not_equity.py`, R9 by the recorded digest and its
comparison in `live status --check`, R10 by the pinned `policy_digest()`.  Naming the split is the
point: a property test that quietly covered six of eleven rules while an acceptance criterion said
eleven would be the same defect this project keeps finding.
