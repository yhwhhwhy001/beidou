"""Thirteen 「重开条件」 were written and none was read.  This is the reader, and its refusals.

2026-09-09's audit counted `REFUTED` 69 times in `RESEARCH_LOG.md` and thirteen blocks naming what
would have to become true for a closed hypothesis to be reopened.  A grep for `REFUTED` and `reopen`
over `beidou_governance/` and `governance_cmd.py` returned nothing.  So a condition that came true
would never be noticed, and the hypothesis would stay closed by neglect instead of by evidence.

The concrete cost was visible the moment the reader existed: regime (#47) was closed needing "块 1 的
数据宽度（OI / 多空比 / 基差 / 清算流）", and three of those four landed between 2026-09-09 and
2026-09-10.  Whether three of four IS that width is the operator's judgement - the point is that
nobody had been told there was a judgement to make.

**The refusal this file exists to hold.**  Nine of thirteen conditions cannot be asked of a machine.
They are `NEEDS A PERSON`, they are never MET and never NOT MET, and the summary counts them out loud.
The temptation - to give each of them some checkable proxy so the list looks complete - would turn a
judgement into a predicate that happens to be answerable, which is how a gate becomes decoration.  A
list that reported "0 MET" over nine unaskable conditions would read as an all-clear.

    """13 blocks were counted on 2026-09-10; P30 ruled a 14th on 2026-09-12.

    The number is a ratchet, not a fact about the world: a condition written into RESEARCH_LOG and not
    into the list is the exact gap this file exists to close, and the only way to notice it is for the
    count to be pinned.  Raise it in the commit that adds the entry, never to make a red test green.

    2026-09-17 (Q-SF2) raised it 14 -> 19, and the five split into two kinds.  Three were the gap this
    test is named for: breakout, chanlun and pairs each had a reopen condition written into RESEARCH_LOG
    (block 6 s4.5, P27's second point, P28's correction) that the 2026-09-09 audit did not count, so they
    sat closed with nobody reading their terms.  The other two are a different thing and their entries say
    so out loud: meanrev and xsmom had NO condition anywhere - their rulings say only "do not re-run" - and
    what the list now carries was PROPOSED by that day's pit diagnostics, not ruled by the operator.  Both
    are `check: operator`, so they can only ever report NEEDS A PERSON; writing an unruled condition down
    is how a judgement gets queued instead of forgotten, which is what this file is for.  What would be
    wrong is letting either of those two become machine-askable before the operator has ruled it.

    2026-09-19 raised it 20 -> 21 for `risk-g11-denominator`, and that entry widens what this file holds:
    every other one is a REFUTED hypothesis waiting to be reopened, and this one is an ACCEPTED RISK waiting
    to be re-ruled.  The shape is identical - a judgement, a condition, and no reader - and so is the failure
    it prevents: the operator chose "do nothing until the freeze lifts" over three priced alternatives on
    2026-09-19, and with no entry that choice would have expired on 2026-10-13 into nobody remembering it had
    been a choice.  `check: date_after` because the date is the only part a machine can answer; the entry's
    own `condition` says in as many words that the date is necessary and not sufficient.
