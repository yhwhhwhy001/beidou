"""Operator ruling 2026-09-23: a failed family gate sends a main back to probe, and something now says so.

`Event.FAMILY_GATE_FAILED` had a definition, a handler that RETIRED, and no producer.  The 2026-09-23
checklist (`docs/analysis/2026-09-23-external-prompt-checklist-vs-beidou.md`) found the 09-19 refusal of
tsmom - OOS 1.2306 against 1.5238 - sitting in `governance/verdicts.jsonl` with no consequence.  The
operator ruled the consequence is demotion, not retirement.  These tests pin the three halves: what the
rule does, where the event comes from, and that `advance` folds it in time order.  The last one is the
easy one to get wrong: a refusal folded after a later window sits behind the watermark and never counts.
