"""DL-G4 / DRILL-G1 and G5: the registry write is a transaction, and the gate it asks is the real one.

Q9 (operator ruling, 2026-09-08) removed the human confirmation point from single promotions: the
machine writes the registry from the first transaction.  What stands in for the person is this
module's ability to undo itself, so these tests are the compensating control, not paperwork.

DRILL-G1 is run against the SHIPPED registry with a real corruption - a report whose sha256 no longer
matches - and against the REAL startup gate, `beidou_live.config.registry_evidence_problems`.  Using a
stub gate here would test that `apply` calls whatever it is given, which is not the question; the
question is whether the thing it is given refuses what the loop would refuse.
