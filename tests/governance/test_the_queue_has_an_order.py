"""§3 requires a candidate to be "队首" before it may enter probe, and nothing recorded an order.

`queue_head`'s first version was honest about it - it refused whenever two candidates were queued,
rather than breaking the tie by dictionary order - but the consequence was a gate that **can never
open**, not one that is strict.  That is the half of the state machine the 2026-09-09 audit counted as
missing (eight of nine transitions implemented, this one half).

The order is FIFO by the instant a candidate entered QUEUED, recorded in `Policy.queue_order` so that
changing it is a rule version change (R10).  Every alternative - marginal Sharpe, evidence date,
fraction - is a SELECTION rule that would need its own pre-registration, and would let a candidate
improve its place by being re-scored.
