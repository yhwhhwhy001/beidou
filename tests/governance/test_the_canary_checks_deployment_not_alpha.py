"""DL-G5 / DRILL-G4: six deployment-health checks, and the boundary the Phase 7 review drew.

The review's sharpest correction (KILL-AR-04) was that calling the canary a filter would do two kinds
of harm: let a bad candidate through on a technicality, and let a good one be blocked by an unrelated
venue hiccup - then be recorded as evidence against the candidate.  So the first test here is the
negative one: a shadow that is perfectly healthy and perfectly unprofitable must pass.

Every rate is measured against the ARMED loop's own cycles over the same window.  A constant would
fail the whole canary on a day the venue was slow, which is the false negative that teaches an
operator to ignore an instrument.
