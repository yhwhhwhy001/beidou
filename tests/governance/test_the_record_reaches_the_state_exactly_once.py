"""`governance advance`: the first production caller `lifecycle.apply` and `state.write` ever had.

Until 2026-09-10 the state machine could refuse a promotion and could not record one.  `tenure` derived
`WINDOW_SURVIVED` and `PNL_STOP` from `cycles.jsonl`, `evaluate` knew what they meant, and the two were
never introduced: `governance_state.json` was maintained by hand (one commit in `git log`), so R4's
`promotions_this_window`, R5's `consecutive_probe_stops` and R7's `probe_entries` were typed numbers
that no record had to agree with.

The tests here are mostly about running it TWICE.  Folding is not idempotent by nature - the counters
this writes are cumulative - and the counter usually named is not the one at risk: `probe_entries`
moves on `queued -> probe`, which no event derived from the record produces.  What a second fold moves
is `windows_survived`, which reaches main in four and a half windows instead of nine, and
`consecutive_probe_stops`, where one stop counted twice is R5's two and freezes promotion for six
windows.  Both are pinned below, byte for byte.
