"""M-G05's denominator was growing by one every day somebody ran a read-only command.

Measured 2026-09-12 on the live ledger: three `family_gate` rows, byte-identical reasons
("OOS 1.8087 vs 1.5149 at N=185"), written 09-09, 09-10 and 09-12 - one per day someone ran
`beidou governance gate` - all three pending, `governance divergence` reporting "3 pending review".

`record()`'s own docstring already named the failure: "a denominator that counts how often somebody
typed a read-only command is not measuring the machine".  It then keyed idempotence on the DATE, which
leaves that hole open one day wide.  Ten quiet days of running the gate would have carried M-G05 to
its quorum of 10 - Pre-A′'s only falsifier, satisfied by ten re-readings of one ruling with no
decision made and nothing changed.

A ruling is (gate, subject, call, reasons).  The reasons carry the numbers, so a gate that flips, or
one ruling on a moved ledger, is a different ruling and still lands its own row.
