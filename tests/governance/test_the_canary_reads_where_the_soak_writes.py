"""The L4 soak wrote one directory and all three of its readers looked in another.

Found 2026-09-12, the first time `deploy/run_shadow.sh` was ever started (operator ruling the same
day - one machine only - removed the blocker, which was that a data-only research machine has no
trading credentials and `--dry-run` still builds the venue).

    run_shadow.sh       --state-dir .beidou/live-shadow
    build_store         .beidou/live-shadow  ->  .beidou/live-shadow-dry-run
    governance canary   --shadow-dir default .beidou/live-shadow
    governance plan     --shadow-dir default .beidou/live-shadow
    governance apply    --shadow-dir default .beidou/live-shadow

Each of the five lines is correct on its own.  Together the soak would have run its full 168 hours
while every reader said "L4: no shadow record", and AC-G5 would then have failed for a reason with
nothing to do with the candidate.  27th instance of this repository's most frequent defect.

The suffix now has one definition - `store_directory` - and the store and the readers both use it.
