"""`governance apply` wrote the registry without asking a single governance rule (2026-09-09 audit).

The largest instance of this repository's recurring defect, and the one with the machine's hand on it.
`apply` asked two questions: is the autonomy switch on, and does the startup gate accept the result.
That gate - `registry_evidence_problems` - checks evidence pointers, their sha256 and the construction
each was produced under.  It is a per-ENTRY check, so it cannot see a sum, a count, a calendar or a
history, which is precisely what R3, R4, R5, R7 and K-EX14 are.

So §3's whole precondition list for `queued -> probe` was decorative on the one code path that
promotes, and §0's acceptance of AR-18 - no human confirmation point, because "R6 回滚 + Canary + R3
预算 + P&L stop" carries the risk - was resting on two controls that had no caller anywhere in the
tree.  `lifecycle.apply` and `state.write` still have none; this closes the half that decides.

The first test below is the one that matters: two sleeves, each matching its own evidence exactly, so
the startup gate passes every entry it looks at while the book hands 2/3 of itself to unproven code.
