"""`research mine` enumerated the DL-D4 leaves and loaded a panel without them.

Every `oi` and `lsr` candidate has raised `ExprError` in every round since DL-D4 shipped.  Measured
2026-09-09 over two consecutive rounds: `outcomes.errored = 90` both times, and the 90 are exactly the
54 `oi` plus 36 `lsr` candidates.  Not one metrics candidate has ever been scored.

The reason is one missing keyword.  `research decompose` loads `metrics=True` with a comment saying why
it must be unconditional - enumeration happens after the panel exists, so the panel cannot be
conditioned on what will be enumerated - and `research mine`, the command that actually enumerates
them, was written without it.  `research validate` asks `_wants_metrics(strategy)`, which is right
there because a strategy id is known in advance; the miner has no strategy, which is the whole point.

Two things made it survive:

* the per-row `error` field records the real reason, and only `outcomes.errored` reaches the summary
  the reader sees - so a family that could not run read as a family that ran and lost;
* the count is stable and plausible.  90 of 658 looks like a search rejecting malformed combinations,
  which is a thing this search legitimately does.

So the assertion below is not "the command works".  It is that the panel the miner scores on carries
every column the candidates it just enumerated declare they read - the two halves joined, because each
half was individually correct.
