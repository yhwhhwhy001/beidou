"""The D-041 bridge has to survive its own expiry on the bash launchd actually runs.

launchd starts the loop as `/bin/bash deploy/run_live.sh` (deploy/com.beidou.live.plist), and /bin/bash
on macOS is 3.2.57.  Before bash 4.4, expanding an EMPTY array under `set -u` is an "unbound variable"
error.  The bridge (2026-09-18) starts from `BRIDGE=()` and appends `--allow-unvalidated` only before
`BRIDGE_UNTIL`, so from that date the array is empty - and the launcher's last line, `"${BRIDGE[@]}"`,
exited 1 before `beidou` ran.  The strict evidence gate the bridge hands back to would never have been
reached, and every relaunch would have died on the same line.

Found 2026-09-25 while preparing for 10-13 (docs/analysis/2026-09-25-october-13-readiness.md): the block
copied out and the date stubbed, 09-25 and 10-12 exit 0, 10-13 and 10-14 exit 1.  That branch had never
executed - the loop's stderr has no `bridge EXPIRED` line - and no test ran the script.

Two checks, because CI cannot reproduce the failure: its bash is 5.x, where the same expansion is legal.

- The text check runs everywhere.  Every `"${NAME[@]}"` in `deploy/*.sh` has to be the guarded form
  `${NAME[@]+"${NAME[@]}"}`, which every bash expands to nothing when the array is empty.
- The behaviour check runs the launcher's own bridge block, date and `exec` stubbed, on this machine's
  /bin/bash.  On the operator's Mac that is the bash that failed.  On CI it still checks the bridge's
  logic: on before the date, off on and after it, the loop's own arguments passed through.
