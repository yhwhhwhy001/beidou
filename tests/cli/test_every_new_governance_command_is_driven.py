"""Every command added on 2026-09-09/10, driven the way the operator drives it.

`governance canary` shipped broken on its first real run - `load_jsonl` takes text and it was handed a
Path - and nothing caught it, because a command added to make a module reachable and then never
exercised is the same defect one level out from the one it was added to fix.  The module had tests.
The command had none.

So this file drives each command through `CliRunner` on real files, and asserts on what an operator
would read off the terminal.  It is deliberately shallow: the arithmetic belongs to the modules'
own tests, and duplicating it here would make both harder to change.  What it holds is that the
command RUNS, reads the files it says it reads, and exits the way its `--check` promises.
