"""M6 step 1: the panel layer left `research_cmd`, and every caller's address survived it.

The seam was chosen by measurement rather than by tidiness.  Twenty-nine scripts under `scratchpad/` -
the reproductions behind D-035's ladder bootstrap, P26, P29, P32, D-039's band sweep and the exit
reachability tables - open with `from beidou_cli.research_cmd import _load, _membership,
_resolve_symbols`.  The evidence base of this repository imports three private functions out of a
command-line module, which is the concrete form of "reproducing a validation report means importing
CLI privates".  Splitting the nine COMMANDS apart, the other reading of M6, would not have touched it.

So this commit moves definitions and keeps addresses: one definition, two names for it, asserted here
rather than promised in a docstring.  The shim is temporary - when `evaluate_book` sinks into
`beidou_alpha.validation` these go with it and the scripts get a home that is not a CLI - and the
tests below are what will fail loudly if that second move forgets one of them.
