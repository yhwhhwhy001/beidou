"""Two layer-0 items with one shape: a choice that was being made without anyone naming it.

**`--select`** (round 7's副产品 1).  `validate` picks `best_params` by full-sample Sharpe, and the
registry's startup gate compares the running params against that field.  So a candidate that wins on
a PRE-REGISTERED rule but is a shade lower on the full sample can never be a grid report's
`best_params`: H-001's rule was "OOS >= baseline - 0.05 AND drawdown improves AND turnover falls",
the sign arm won it and lost the argmax, and adopting it took a second single-configuration report
(`tsmom-validation-20260904T020459Z`).  Naming the cell is the cheaper half.  What keeps the naming
honest is that `--select` requires `--prereg` - a commit whose timestamp lands in the artefact - and
that the argmax is recorded beside it whichever rule won.

**The ensemble guard.**  `combine_targets` takes a weighted MEAN of a book's per-strategy targets and
`build_weights` sizes on that number, so two strategies at +1 and -1 produce 0 (a close) and three at
+1/+1/-1 produce a third of a position.  That is the magnitude back in a book whose
`conviction_mode: sign` was adopted on D-024's measurement that magnitude carries no return
information.  The combination has never been scored.  Today the refusal is unreachable - both books
run one strategy - which is exactly when it is worth writing: the day a second one is added is the
day it should be a decision rather than a side effect of an `enabled: true`.
