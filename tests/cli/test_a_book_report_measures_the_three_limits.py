"""`research book` writes the three §3 limits, so `validated -> booked` stops reading a literal True.

The gap this closes was not an argument about thresholds.  `beidou_governance.lifecycle` has read
`slippage_stress_pass`, `max_correlation_with_running` and `turnover_ratio_to_main` since Phase 0, and
`replay.py` supplied `True / 0.0 / 0.0` for all three because **no book report carried the fields**:
seven validation reports had `slippage_stress` and zero book reports did, and `research correlate`
wrote a separate artefact with nothing linking it back to a book.  A rule that reads a field nothing
writes cannot run, however well it is argued.

The end-to-end run matters more than the unit tests beside it, because the failure mode was never in
the arithmetic - it was in the wiring.

    The 2.0 bps row must reproduce the report's own marginal block to the digit - that level IS the

    difference means the stress is re-pricing something other than the decision.  And every Sharpe CURVE
    the arm reports must decay monotonically as slippage rises, because cost enters each net stream one
    way.

    Monotonicity is asserted of the curves and NOT of the marginal, and the difference is the whole
    lesson of 2026-09-14.  The marginal is a DIFFERENCE of two Sharpes, so its slope in cost is
    `tau_main / sigma_main - tau_booked / sigma_booked`: it falls only while the booked pair is the more
    cost-sensitive of the two, which is an empirical fact about this fixture and not a property of the
    wiring.  At `vol_target` 0.60 it inverts.  Four symbols at `max_weight` 0.15 cap gross at 0.60, so
    both books clip, clipping pins weights and pins turnover, and the main book then loses 0.2204 of
    Sharpe across this bps range against the booked pair's 0.2014 - the marginal RISES by 0.019 while
    both curves still fall.  The old assertion read that as `paying more cannot help`, which made a risk
    re-pricing look like a wiring bug.  (The clipping is not a fixture artefact of no interest: on the
    live universe `config/live.demo.yaml` records 111/293 cycles clipping at k=0.60, though only
    BTCUSDT.  It is the four-symbol fixture that turns it from partial into total.)
