"""G3: the daily report's `beta` block is `report beta`'s reading, bit for bit.

Until 2026-09-23 the D-045 decomposition lived inside the `report beta` command, so it was read only
when somebody ran it by hand.  The daily report now prints it every hour.  Two readers of one number
are safe only while they share one computation: the first four answers to D-045's question differed
because the benchmark did, and a second copy of the price fill is how that would come back quietly.

So the two commands are run here end to end, on a state whose prices are the real August 2026 klines
read through the real parquet layout, and their JSON is compared as text.  JSON writes each float as
the shortest repr that round-trips, so equal text is equal bits.

The state carries every trap `report beta` handles at least once: `closes` missing from the older
cycle rows (the archive fills them), a symbol leaving the universe mid-window, a symbol whose parquet
cannot be parsed (a gap, never an error), one bar of the operator's own fills, and a change of net
exposure halfway through.
