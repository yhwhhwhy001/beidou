"""The miner's summary printed how many candidates failed and not one word of why.

That is what let the DL-D4 gap survive two full rounds on 2026-09-09.  Each failed row carried its own
reason - `error: "ExprError: long/short ratio needs panel.metrics[...], which this panel does not
carry"` - and the summary said `90 candidate(s) could not be evaluated; see the report`.  90 of 658 is
a perfectly plausible number for a search rejecting malformed combinations, which this search does
legitimately, so nothing looked wrong.  A whole family that could not run read as a family that ran and
lost, and the person who wrote "only the count reaches the report" was the same person who then read
only the count.

The property is not "the miner works".  It is that a refusal count is never printed alone.
