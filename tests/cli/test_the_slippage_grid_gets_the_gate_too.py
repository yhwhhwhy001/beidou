"""The gate was attached to the grid that answers a different question.

`cost_stress_gate` re-asks D-028's threshold while scaling `turnover_bps`, which scales the taker fee
with it.  The fee is a contract constant - VIP0 taker is 5.0 bps whatever happens to execution - so
`x1.5` bills 7.5 bps of fee that no venue will ever charge, and its margin is not the margin of a
slippage assumption being wrong.  `slippage_levels`' docstring has made that argument since the grid
was added; what was missing is that only the multiplier grid had a gate, so the artefact answered the
question it was not asked and stayed silent on the one it was.

The trap this closes is subtle rather than absent: the two grids COINCIDE wherever their totals match
(`x1.5` and `slip5.5` are both 10.5 bps), so reading a slippage answer off `x1.5` is correct by
accident at one cell and wrong at every other - including at 4.43, the measured value, which has no
multiplier cell at all and sits exactly where the gate is crossed.
