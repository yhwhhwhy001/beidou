"""L1-07 again, aimed at the half that reports success: a release can clear less than it says.

`kill_switch_targets` is (configured path, account-scoped path), and the second is derived from the
API key - `account_kill_switches()` reads `venue.api_key_env` out of the environment and returns an
EMPTY tuple when it is not there.  That emptiness is right for a paper or offline run, which has no
account to scope to.  It is not right for `beidou live kill-switch`, where it makes the target list
silently shorter than the operator believes it is.

Measured 2026-09-13T20:44Z against the running demo loop, minutes after `live flatten` had engaged
both paths.  A `beidou live kill-switch --release` run from a shell without the `~/.zshrc` exports
printed exactly one line -

    kill switch released: /Users/.../beidou/.beidou/live/KILL_SWITCH

- exited 0, and left `~/Library/Application Support/beidou/<fingerprint>.KILL_SWITCH` in place.  The
guard reads `any(path.exists())`, so the book stayed stopped while the operator had been told it was
released.  `release_kill_switches`\' own docstring is "Release has to clear both or the operator
cannot get back in"; it does exactly that, faithfully, for every path it is handed.  The defect is
upstream of it, in what the command hands over.

The two directions are deliberately not symmetric:

    --release   refuses before touching anything.  A release that cannot be complete must not report
                a success it did not achieve, so nothing is cleared and the missing export is named.
    --engage    still writes what it can, and then exits non-zero.  A kill switch fails toward
                stopping, so refusing to engage because a shell lacks an export would be much the
                worse failure - but a stop weaker than the operator thinks has to say so out loud.
