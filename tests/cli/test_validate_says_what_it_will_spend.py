"""A `research validate` against an enabled registry entry has to say what it will spend (2026-09-17).

Every grid cell appends one ledger row, and the strategy's bucket is the denominator of the D-028
threshold that same strategy's cited evidence has to clear.  `family_gate`'s docstring states the
consequence in four words - "searching more retires your own incumbents" - so the number of cells is
not a performance detail, it is how much of the incumbent's remaining margin the command spends.

What made it a check.  On 2026-09-17 a two-arm A/B was priced to the operator at "2 trials", ran
without `--grid`, and got `DEFAULT_GRIDS["tsmom"]`: sixteen cells per arm, 32 charged.  tsmom's gate
went N 259 -> 293, threshold 1.5572 -> 1.5715, and the incumbent's margin +0.0347 -> +0.0204 - about
35% of the headroom, from a default nobody typed.  The RUNBOOK already said to pass `--grid`.

Scoped to the SHARED ledger on purpose: a redirected run (`BEIDOU_TRIALS_LEDGER`) spends nothing any
gate reads, and `tests/conftest.py` redirects every test, so the guard stays off the suite's back
without an exemption list.  The refusal below therefore has to un-redirect - and it is asserted to
happen BEFORE any data is loaded, which is also what keeps that safe.
