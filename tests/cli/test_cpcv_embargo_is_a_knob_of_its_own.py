"""CPCV's embargo is its own boundary, and splitting it out changed nothing today.

The 2026-09-13 review's orange CPCV entry: `--purge` was doing double duty as the embargo, at 50 bars
against a 720-bar feature lookback, so roughly 670 bars of every training group that sits AFTER a test
block were computed from a window covering that block.  `cpcv_evaluate` selects on those bars, which
makes D-020's `fraction_negative <= 0.10` easier to pass than it should be.

Two things are held here, and the second is the one that matters for this commit:

1. `purge` and `embargo` block DIFFERENT sides, by the amount each names.  There was no test for
   `purge != embargo` at all - the one in `tests/alpha/test_validation.py` passes 5 and 3 and then
   only ever checks the 5 - so nothing would have noticed if the embargo argument were ignored.
2. Leaving `--embargo` off reproduces today's splits and today's CPCV block bit for bit.  Adopting a
   real embargo moves a hard gate and is the operator's pre-registered re-run, not this change.
