"""`research validate` scores all four layers, not only the signal (2026-09-08 audit).

The live book is signal -> sleeve -> exit overlay -> book guards.  `guards=` reached exactly one of
sixteen `run_backtest` call sites and `apply_exits` exactly one, neither in `validate`, so the report
the registry cites - and whose sha256 the startup gate pins - described the first layer alone.
Measured on the shipped configuration before this change: OOS 1.7662 cited against 1.8492 for the book
the loop holds.  The gap was favourable, which is a fact about today's parameters and not about the
pipeline; the same silence covers a gap of either sign.

`--no-guards` / `--no-exits` reproduce the older reports, and are recorded as `null` rather than
omitted so the gate can tell "this run applied none" from "this report predates the field".
