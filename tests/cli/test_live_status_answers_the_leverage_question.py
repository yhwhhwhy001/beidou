"""D-038, one command further: `live status` prints `leverage_set` and nothing to read it against.

D-038 diagnosed this for the daily report and built M-015 for it, and the report renders it well.  The
question still came back a fifth time (2026-09-14), because the command an operator actually reaches for
is `live status` - and it dumps `state.to_dict()`, in which the only per-symbol number is the uniform 5x,
with no counterpart beside it.  Same defect, different command.

These tests pin the two halves the line must carry.  The reading can refuse (a cycle written before
`asset_vol` was recorded, a day with no cycles, too few holdings); the sentence about the venue leverage
cannot, because that is the number the operator came here to look at.
