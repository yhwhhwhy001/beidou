"""R2: re-running a search space charges the family twice for one hypothesis.

It happened.  On 2026-09-08 a P20 recovery re-ran the same 514-wide space over 24 more bars; every
signature was new because the data range moved, so 514 rows were appended and the family's prior went
514 -> 1,028 with nothing on the terminal saying so.  Ruling Q7 reverted the rows on K-EX07's
precedent - but a ruling after the fact is not a rule, and the next session would have done the same.

A note on what is NOT done here, because the plan asked for it and it would have been wrong.  R2 was
written as "`search_space_version` 由空串改为必填".  That field is deliberately EMPTY on the `mined`
bucket's rows, and the reason is recorded beside them: a candidate examined in a 267-wide search and
again in a 514-wide one is one hypothesis looked at twice, so stamping the width on would charge
267 + 514 for a family of 514 - inflating N in the direction that looks rigorous and is simply wrong.
Making it mandatory would re-introduce exactly that.  The rule's INTENT - refuse a second enumeration -
needs the space recorded where the next run can read it, not on every row, so it goes in the shortlist
report and the refusal happens before the expensive scoring starts.
