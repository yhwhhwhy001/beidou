"""The one human confirmation point Q9 did NOT remove.

Q9 (operator ruling, 2026-09-08) took the confirmation point off a SINGLE promotion: the machine
writes the registry from the first transaction, because "人容易犯错".  It did not take off the
decision to let the machine write at all - the plan keeps exactly three human points, and this is one
of them (governance enable/disable).

The asymmetry is deliberate and is what these tests hold: enabling asks, disabling never does.
Stopping is always allowed, and a stop that needs a confirmation is a stop that arrives late.
