"""DL-D5 / RISK-G3: the loop is authorised by the ingest that produced its data, or by nothing at all.

`LiveEngine.spot_verification` was `None` in the constructor and nothing ever set it, so the gate
`spot_refusal` guards could not be opened by any measurement, correct or not.  Handing it in from
`live_cmd` is the whole of the wiring, and this is the test that drives it - the 2026-09-09 lesson is
that a module made reachable and then never called is the same defect one level up.

Two properties, and the second is the one that keeps this honest: the verification comes from the DATA
ROOT the loop was pointed at, so a run against a root nobody ingested refuses even when another root on
the same machine has a perfectly good measurement in it.
