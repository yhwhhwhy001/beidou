"""DL-G5: the two flags a canary needs, and the one rule that keeps them from being a second book.

`--state-dir` and `--registry` exist so a shadow loop can soak a candidate registry beside the armed
one.  Both refuse to run armed, for reasons that are different and both load-bearing:

* `state.json` carries the day's equity mark, the leaving set, the exit anchors and `stopped_books`.
  An armed loop reading a different copy of it is a second book trading the same account, and the
  account lock would NOT stop it - that lock is keyed on the API key, not on the directory.
* An armed loop is promoted by WRITING the registry file, as a transaction that can roll back
  (`beidou_governance.promote`).  Pointing an armed loop at a different file instead would produce a
  running book whose registry nothing on disk describes, which is KILL-Q15 with the sign flipped.
