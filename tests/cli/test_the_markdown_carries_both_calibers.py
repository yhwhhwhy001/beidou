"""R0 / DL-G1 and KILL-Q2, in the artefact a reader actually opens.

Three notes already travel with the numbers they qualify (`_MARGIN_BUFFER_NOTE`, `_embargo_note`,
`_pbo_note`), written because "a caveat reachable only by reading the implementation is not a
disclosure to the person reading the artefact - it is a disclosure to the person who already knows".
Two more facts were in exactly that position, and this file holds their fix:

* **Both calibers.**  `oos_selection_whole_library` has been in the JSON since DL-G1, whose comment
  says an artefact carrying only the chosen caliber "cannot be used to re-open the choice".  The
  Markdown carried only the chosen one, so for a reader who does not open the JSON the artefact was
  precisely that.  On `tsmom-validation-20260913T182325Z.json` - the report the live registry cites -
  the gate at N=242 leaves +0.04 and the library at N=2,914 leaves -0.23.
* **What `oos_is_full_sample_tail: True` means.**  `validate` has said it on stdout since KILL-Q2,
  and stdout is not an artefact: the run scrolls away, and a bare boolean beside a Sharpe that reads
  like an out-of-sample estimate is what D-043 later had to cap at WEAK_PASS.

Neither changes a verdict: `verdict.decide` reads `oos_selection` and nothing else, which
`tests/alpha/test_the_other_caliber_is_reported_not_applied.py` holds from the other side.  Neither
touches the JSON payload either, so every archived sha256 stays comparable with the ones the registry
already cites - the same constraint the first three notes were written under.
