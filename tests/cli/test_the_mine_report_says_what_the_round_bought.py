"""`research mine` reported four ways of counting rows and nothing about what the round bought.

Three numbers were missing from the artefact, and each one is a question an operator has had to
answer by hand at least once:

* **how many distinct hypotheses** the family's denominator is about.  The `ledger` block carried
  `charged`, `candidates`, `declared_remainder` and `family_prior` - all counts of rows - so the
  2026-09-14 analysis read `family_prior.after = 2731` as "2,731 candidates were tried" and judged
  the miner on it.  The bucket holds 676 distinct `param_key`s.  Nothing in the artefact could have
  contradicted the reading.
* **whether the round reproduced its predecessor.**  2026-09-09 09:50Z charged 658 rows under a
  `--reauthorize` whose stated reason was "3b49af8 fixed the 90 errors, re-run them"; all 658
  Sharpes came back identical to 08:29Z and the same 90 still errored, because the real fix
  (`f4ea9de`) had not landed.  The artefact records the authorisation and never whether it came true.
* **whether the ledger was redirected.**  `BEIDOU_TRIALS_LEDGER` is, in `resolve_ledger_path`'s own
  words, a variable "whose only possible purpose is to not be charged" - and a redirected run printed
  exactly what a charging run printed.

These are source assertions, which prove a rule is wired and never that it is right (that is
2026-09-09's own lesson, in the file next door).  The correctness half lives in
`tests/alpha/test_the_ledger_says_how_many_hypotheses_not_only_how_many_rows.py` and
`tests/alpha/test_a_rerun_that_reproduces_its_predecessor_says_so.py`, where the two functions are
exercised against real inputs.  They are here because the failure mode is OMISSION - a field absent
from a payload, not wrong in it - and an omission is invisible to any test that does not name it.
