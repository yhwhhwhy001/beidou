"""A book report bands each arm the way the construction bands that book, and says which band it applied.

`research book` prices three books: the main book alone, the main book plus a fraction of the sleeve,
and the sleeve alone.  Once D2 and D3 were on in the profile (2026-09-17), the report banded them three
different ways.  `banded()` - written 2026-09-03, before either knob existed - passed neither to the two
single arms.  The combined arm went through `combine_books`, which passed D2 but not D3.  So D-018's
marginal, total minus main, carried a band difference as well as the sleeve.

On the registry book (tsmom + 1/3 flow, pit, data to 2026-09-22) that difference sat on a knife edge:
the fold win rate is 0.4 as the arms were banded and 0.6 once they are banded alike, the fourth fold's
delta moving from -0.019 to +0.001.  The verdict did not move - the delta is negative either way - but a
check that flips on the ruler is not reading the sleeve.

End to end, on the same principle as `test_a_book_report_measures_the_three_limits.py`: the failure was
in the wiring, never the arithmetic.  The single arms are held to the books `research backtest
--no-exits --no-guards` prices for the same strategies - one-book construction, every band knob, the same
bare-plus-band protocol.  The combined arm is held to the rule in
`tests/alpha/test_the_multi_book_band_is_the_one_book_band.py`.
