"""R1's mine-round limit was reported by one command and asked by none.

Found 2026-09-10, while pricing a fifth round in a window that allows four.  `governance next` reads
`window_spend` and prints `4/4 mine rounds`; `scheduler.next_action` consumes `mine_refusals`.  Neither
is `research mine`, which imports nothing from `beidou_governance.budget` and has never asked whether
the window had a round left.  So R1's round limit was advisory: the number was correct, printed, and
attached to no gate - the twenty-first instance of the shape the 2026-09-09 audit is named for.

R2 was never advisory, which is the contrast worth stating.  It refuses in `research mine` itself and
carries `--reauthorize` as a named, recorded override.  R1 had the refusal written (`mine_refusals`),
the calendar written (`admission.window_start`), and no call site.

**Asked before the panel loads, not after enumeration.**  R2's check needs `search.space_digest` and
therefore has to come after enumeration; R1 needs only the ledger and the calendar, so a run that is
not allowed to happen is refused before it scores 243 candidates over 49,000 bars.

The override is `--reauthorize` too, deliberately: one flag for "the operator has ruled this run
happens anyway", recorded in the shortlist report either way.  A second flag would let a run bypass
R1 while looking untouched to R2.
