"""A restart must not make DL-Q0 / R9 report a divergence the restart just resolved.

``cycles.jsonl`` is append-only and carries no process identity, so its newest digest row belongs to
whichever process last completed a cycle - after a restart, the dead one.  Reading that back as "what
the loop is running" compares the previous process's answer against the current file.

Measured 2026-09-14 on the real loop: the host came back at 19:00:14Z, the loop at 19:10:55Z, the
19:11:19Z bar was SKIPPED (679s late) and wrote no governance digest, so the newest one was still
18:00:29Z's ``75764f646ca6`` from the dead process.  ``policy.py`` had been edited at 17:50Z - eighty
minutes BEFORE that process started - so the running process held ``d62ac59fa95c``, exactly what the
file said.  The check reported them as different.  ``com.beidou.check`` fires at :10, inside that
window every time, and ``state.restarts`` is past 43.

bc986ec3 found this for the registry and put the digests on the restart heartbeat - but changed no
reader, so the fix never took effect and its test asserted the write half by source inspection.  These
tests assert the READ half, for both instruments, through the CLI.
