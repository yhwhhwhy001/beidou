"""DL-G9 / T-G9-1: the pre-registration is a field in the artefact, not a paragraph in a log.

DL-K3 asks that a pre-registration commit be earlier than the report it registers.  Until now the only
record of that was a RESEARCH_LOG paragraph plus a reader willing to run `git show`, so the Phase 0
governance replay had to suspend the condition for all 48 archived reports - the rule could never fire,
for any artefact, ever.

The commit's OWN timestamp is what is recorded, not the moment `--prereg` was typed.  Recording the
latter would make the ordering trivially true and the check worthless.
