"""DL-L1 at the command line: arming the loop, and losing the race politely.

Two things the lock alone cannot do.

*Arming.*  ``live run`` sends real orders by default; the only thing between a worktree experiment
and the live account was remembering to type ``--dry-run``.  Non-dry-run now requires ``--armed``,
which is a sentence the operator has to write, not one they have to remember not to omit.

*Losing.*  A refused instance exits **0**.  Under ``KeepAlive.SuccessfulExit=false`` a non-zero exit
would be relaunched every ThrottleInterval and would alert every time, so the failure mode of the
guard would be an alert storm about the guard working correctly (KILL-R20(d)).
