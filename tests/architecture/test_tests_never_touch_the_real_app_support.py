"""No test may write into the operator's real ``~/Library/Application Support/beidou``.

Measured, not hypothesised.  On 2026-09-07T19:20:11Z a suite run left
``682f6697fa93eca6.KILL_SWITCH`` containing ``engaged`` in the live state directory of a machine
that was trading.  It came from `test_kill_switch_is_per_account.py::test_flatten_engages_every_path`:
that test monkeypatches a FAKE env var name (`BEIDOU_TEST_KEY=some-key`) and points the profile's
`kill_switch_path` at `tmp_path`, so both halves an author would think to isolate were isolated -
and `account_kill_switches()` still reached `account_kill_switch_path(key)` with no `root=`, which
defaults to `APP_SUPPORT` under the real `Path.home()`.  `sha256("some-key")[:16]` is that filename.

Two facts about why it mattered, stated separately because they have different severities:

* What actually happened was harmless to trading.  The loop watches the fingerprint of the key it
  holds (`b9a2701b96f1ae68`), the file carried a foreign one, and `kill_switch_engaged` asks whether
  *its own* paths exist.  The book kept trading, correctly.
* What it left behind was a file named `*.KILL_SWITCH` reading `engaged`, sitting beside the live
  account's lock - the single most misreadable artifact this directory can hold during an incident.
  And the isolation it relied on was the env var NAME being fake.  A test written against the real
  profile's `api_key_env` (`config/live.demo.yaml` names `BEIDOU_BINANCE_API_KEY`, which is exported
  in the operator's interactive shell) would have written the LIVE fingerprint, and because a kill
  switch fails toward stopping, the book would have halted until somebody deleted the file by hand.

The guard is `isolated_app_support` in `tests/conftest.py`: `beidou_live.lock.APP_SUPPORT` is
redirected for every test, the way `isolated_trials_ledger` already redirects the trials ledger, and
for the same reason its docstring gives - the failure mode of forgetting is silent.

This file is what keeps that guard sufficient.  A single redirected constant only covers the package
while the package has exactly ONE anchor to the real home, and only covers the tests while no test
rebuilds the path behind it.  Both are checked below, statically, because a filesystem sweep of the
real directory would race the running loop that writes its logs there.

Stated limit: these rules catch `Path.home()`, `expanduser` and `HOME`.  A test that hardcodes an
absolute path string would not be caught, and nothing here pretends otherwise.
