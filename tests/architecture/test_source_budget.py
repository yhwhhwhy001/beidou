"""M-003: the non-alpha line budget is measured, so a breach is visible instead of assumed away.

The plan set a budget - `beidou_live` <= 2,000 lines, non-alpha <= 6,000, and at least 60% of the source
in `beidou_alpha` - and made exceeding it trigger a KILL-003 re-review.  Nothing ever measured it, so the
budget was breached without anyone noticing: the audit found non-alpha at 6,761 lines against 6,000, and
`beidou_live` at 2,776 against 2,000.

This test does not enforce the plan's numbers, because meeting them today would mean deleting tested code
the operator asked for, which is a worse outcome than carrying the debt.  It ratchets instead: today's
measurement is the ceiling, so the breach cannot grow while the operator decides whether to re-price the
budget or spend effort shrinking it.  That decision is theirs and is recorded as open in the research log.

# The first version of this file set beidou_live at 2,900 from the audit's own 2,776 reading and failed
# immediately at 3,043, which is the ratchet doing its job on its author: the remediation itself - the
# per-strategy income drift, the leg split, the probe correlation, the exit and pool sections - added
# about 270 lines to that package.  Raising a ceiling is allowed only in the commit that says why, and
# this is that sentence.  It then failed a second time on beidou_alpha, for the sign-bucketed IC that
# closed KILL-042.  Final measurement after the whole remediation: alpha 3,654, live 3,171, cli 2,276.
# The gap to the plan's 2,000 for beidou_live is 1,171 lines, and the alpha share is 34% against a 60%
