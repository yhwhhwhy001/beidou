"""M-003's second threshold, which had no instrument (refactor plan §11).

The plan set three numbers under M-003: non-alpha lines <= 6,000, the suite under **30 seconds**, and
zero non-alpha files touched to change one signal.  Only the first was ever measured, by
`test_source_budget.py` - whose own docstring records what happens to the other kind:

    "Nothing ever measured it, so the budget was breached without anyone noticing."

That is exactly what happened here.  Measured 2026-09-07: **45.3 / 47.0 / 47.1 seconds** over three
consecutive idle runs, against a threshold of 30.  Breached by half, silently, for some unknown span.

**Why this ratchet is loose where the line ratchet is exact, and what makes up the difference.**  Lines
are deterministic; wall clock is not.  The three runs above spread 1.8s (~4%) on an idle Apple-silicon
laptop, and CI is `ubuntu-latest`, commonly two to three times slower for this numpy-bound suite.  A
ceiling set snugly at 47 would fail runs that changed nothing, and a gate that cries wolf gets deleted -
returning us to no instrument at all, the state this file exists to leave.  So the ceiling catches a
**step change**, not a drift: a sleep, a network call, an accidental O(n^2) fixture.

Drift is real too, and a loose gate cannot see it - so the measurement is **printed on every full run**
whether it passes or not.  The gate answers "did something break"; the printed line is what lets a human
notice 47 becoming 60 over a month.  Splitting the two is the point: neither number pretends to be the
other.

The plan's 30 seconds is kept in `PLAN_SECONDS` and reported as breached rather than quietly redefined,
the same way `PLAN_BUDGET` keeps the 6,000.
