"""The deploy plists have to be valid XML, not merely acceptable to one lenient parser.

`deploy/com.beidou.paper-l3.plist` shipped on 2026-09-09 with `--paper` inside an XML comment.  Two
dashes in a row end a comment, so the file was not well-formed XML; `plistlib` refuses it outright.
launchd loaded it anyway - CFPropertyList is more forgiving than expat - so the soak ran and nothing
said a word.  That is the defect shape the 2026-09-09 audit found seventeen times over: something that
works because of what a particular reader tolerates rather than because it is correct.

What it would have cost: the L3 soak is a seven-day accumulating criterion, and a plist that stops
loading stops the soak silently.  The comment in that very file says a soak that is not running
accumulates nothing.

**This file checks the repo copies only.**  The file launchd actually reads lives under the operator's
real `~/Library/LaunchAgents`, and `test_tests_never_touch_the_real_app_support.py` forbids any test
from resolving the real home - categorically, because a static guard cannot tell a read from a write
and should not have to.  So the installed copies are checked by `deploy/run_check.sh`, which is the
thing that legitimately runs against this machine.  The division is: the suite guards the source, the
hourly check guards the deployment.
