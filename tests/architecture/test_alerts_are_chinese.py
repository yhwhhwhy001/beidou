"""Operator ruling 2026-09-08: the Lark channel is read in Chinese, so it is written in Chinese.

A translation is a state, not an act - it holds until the next alert is added, and the next alert is
always written in the language of the code around it, which is English.  So this ratchets the ruling
the way `test_source_budget` ratchets the line budget: every alert body that is *visible in the
source* has to carry at least one CJK character.

Visible means an f-string or a literal handed straight to ``send``.  A message built somewhere else
and passed by name (``send(breach)``) is out of reach here and is covered where it is built -
``liquidation_alert`` in `test_liquidation_wiring`, the guard lines in `test_plan_gaps`, the daily
findings in `test_alert_routing`.  A test that can only see half the call sites still closes the half
that a new alert is written into.
