"""The four ambiguity branches: not sent (retry), maybe sent (unknown), 5xx (unknown), backend timeout (unknown).

A write whose response never arrived is NOT a write that did not happen.  Re-submitting it is how a
loop doubles a position, and the whole `bd-<bar_open_ms>-<symbol>` idempotency scheme (D-003) exists
so the caller can ask the venue what happened instead.  The client's job is to tell the two apart:

* `ConnectError` / `ConnectTimeout` / `ProxyError` / `PoolTimeout` - the connection to the venue was
  never established, so nothing left the process.  Retryable for reads and writes alike.
* any other `TransportError` (`ReadTimeout`, `WriteError`, `RemoteProtocolError`, ...) - the request
  was on the wire.  For a mutating method this raises `OrderOutcomeUnknown` immediately; for a read
  it is just another retry.
* HTTP 5xx - the venue answered, but the answer says nothing about the order.  Same rule.
* HTTP 408 / code -1007 - the venue's own "timed out waiting for the backend, execution status
  unknown".  Same rule; it sat in the retryable codes until 2026-09-25, so a write was re-sent.

There was one file of exchange tests against 611 lines of package and this whole table sat under a
single case of it, which is what these fill in.  DELETE is covered alongside POST because it is
mutating too, and cancelling twice is not free either - the second cancel can race a fill.
