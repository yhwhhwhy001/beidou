"""`_paged` walks a window without silently dropping rows at a page boundary.

Until 2026-09-13 the walk stepped to `last + 1` after a full page, so every row sharing that page's
final millisecond was skipped, and a full page lying entirely inside one millisecond tripped
`last <= cursor` and truncated the window outright.  Neither wrote a log line.  Income shares a
millisecond as a RULE rather than by accident - one funding settlement writes one row per held
symbol, all with the same `fundingTime` - and these are the rows D-021/D-032 attribute money from.

These tests are the regression.  Every one of them asserts the row ORDER as well as the row set:
`beidou_live.engine` reads the result as a time-ordered series, and a fix that recovered the rows
while shuffling them would be a worse bug than the one it replaced.
