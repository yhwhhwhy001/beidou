"""Regression cases for `parse_position`, `account()` and `margin_mode()` - all of them from incidents.

`venue.py:43-75` is thirty lines of parsing that has been wrong in production twice: the
`unRealizedProfit` / `unrealizedProfit` spelling (the two payloads disagree), and the notional that
read zero for every account-derived position because the mark price it was derived from was absent.
`account()` has a third: `totalInitialMargin` coming back as 92233720368.54775807, an int64 overflow
sentinel scaled by 1e8, which made the venue derive `availableBalance` 0 and would have made the
margin scaler refuse every risk-adding order on a 95%-free account.

Each test below is one of those, plus the two that were fixed by reading the payload correctly the
first time (`liquidationPrice` 0, `isolated` vs `marginType`) and so have never had a test either.
