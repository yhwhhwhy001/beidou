"""The HMAC is computed over `urlencode(params)`; the request is encoded by httpx.  Pin them together.

`_sign` signs `urlencode(signed, doseq=True)` and then hands the same dict to httpx, which encodes it
again on its own terms for GET and DELETE.  The two agree today only because every parameter this
client sends is a string or an int, and for those two shapes the encoders happen to agree.  Nothing
says so anywhere and nothing checked it, which is an implicit assumption sitting under every signed
request - and when it breaks the venue answers -1022 "Signature for this request is not valid" for a
request that looks perfectly well formed in the log.

So these tests do not re-derive the expectation from `_sign`.  They read the URL (or form body) the
fake transport actually received, strip `&signature=` off the end, and recompute the HMAC over what
is left - which is exactly the arithmetic the venue performs.  The edge of the assumption is pinned
too: see the `bool` case below, which is one keystroke away from `place_order`'s `reduceOnly`.
