"""`used_weight` is now read, edge-triggered, and still does not sleep.

`X-MBX-USED-WEIGHT-1M` was parsed into `self.used_weight` from the first version and nothing ever
looked at it, while `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` listed "限频" as one of this package's jobs.  A client
walking into the 2,400/minute ceiling therefore looked exactly like an idle one right up to the 429.

What landed instead of a token bucket is a warning, and these tests pin BOTH halves of that choice:
the line appears once per crossing, and the default request path is unchanged - no sleep, no delay,
no extra call.  Active throttling would change what the live loop does mid-run, and the live loop is
running; that is a decision to price on its own, not a side effect of correcting a doc.
