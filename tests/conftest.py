    That is right in production and a live hazard here: a test only has to reach a helper that
    defaults `root=None` and it writes into the directory a trading loop is using.

    It happened.  2026-09-07T19:20:11Z, `682f6697fa93eca6.KILL_SWITCH` reading `engaged`, left in the
    operator's Application Support by `test_flatten_engages_every_path` - which had isolated the
    profile's `kill_switch_path` to `tmp_path` AND used a fake env var name, and still got there
    through `account_kill_switches()`.  Foreign fingerprint, so the running book was unaffected; had
    the test named the real `api_key_env`, a kill switch fails toward stopping and the book would
    have halted until somebody deleted the file by hand.

    Autouse for the ledger's reason: forgetting is silent, and this one is silent in the direction of
    an emergency stop.  `tests/architecture/test_tests_never_touch_the_real_app_support.py` is what
