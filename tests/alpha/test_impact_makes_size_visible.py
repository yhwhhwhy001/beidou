"""DL-C1 / KILL-A: the backtest stops pretending a 40 USDT order and a 4M one cost the same.

Everything else in `backtest.py` is scale-free, and that is arithmetic rather than a finding: gross
P&L, turnover cost and funding are all linear in the weights, so scaling every weight by k leaves the
Sharpe unchanged to the last digit.  The flat 7 bps is what makes that true, it is a good
approximation at demo notional (40-800 USDT), and it is the assumption KILL-Q12 has held real capital
out of scope on since 2026-09-05.

What is asserted here is the SHAPE, never a cost number.  The coefficient is an assumption this system
cannot calibrate - its only fills are demo, and the 5.52 bps measured across them is spread and fee
with no separable impact content - so a test that pinned a bps figure would be pinning a literature
constant and calling it a measurement.  The shape is what has to hold: off by default, the flat model
as the exact limit, monotone in size, superlinear in size, and causal.

(The docstring here used to say "order/ADV around 1e-8, where the model predicts under a hundredth of
a basis point".  That was DL-C1's pre-run estimate and DL-C1's own run retracted it; measured per fill
on 121 real fills it is order/ADV 4.3e-07 median and 0.48 bps notional-weighted - see the 2026-09-09
VWAP section of RESEARCH_LOG.  The retraction had reached the scratchpad script and the log but not
the three places a reader actually looks, of which this was one.)
