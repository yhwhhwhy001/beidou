"""A bucket's row count is not its hypothesis count, and the report has to say both.

2026-09-14.  The `mined` bucket held 2,731 rows and 676 distinct `param_key`s - 4.04 rows per
hypothesis - because `signature` folds on `(param_key, range, symbols, construction, overlay,
symbol set, search space)` and a re-run under a moved `range_end` is deliberately a second trial
(KILL-Q5, conservative by design).  That is the rule and this file does not touch it: `n_trials`
is unchanged by everything here.

What went wrong is a READING.  An analysis read 2,731 as "2,731 candidates were tried", concluded
the space had been searched 2,731 ways, and judged the miner on it.  Nothing in any artefact
contradicted that reading, because no artefact carried the other number.  `dsr_inputs` already
reports `ledger_rows`, `ledger_trials`, `duplicate_rows` and `replayed_rows` - four ways of
counting the same rows - and not once how many distinct hypotheses those rows are about.

So this adds a fifth field that is reported and never gated, for the same reason `all_trials`
exists: a number nobody can see is a number nobody can argue with.
