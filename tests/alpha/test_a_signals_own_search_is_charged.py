"""DL-K2 one level down: a signal that chooses WHICH combinations to trade has made a selection.

`research mine` charges every candidate its search kept, because "a search that costs nothing is a DSR
denominator wrong in the one direction that flatters it".  The same hole was open inside `pairs`: the
refit loop looks at every pair its formation window can form and keeps a handful, and the report that
shipped on 2026-09-08 recorded `n_trials: 4` - the four cells of its parameter grid - for a run that had
examined 19,578 distinct pairs of the 20,910 the panel could form.

What is asserted here is the shape of the accounting, not that number: the census counts the search the
SCORES came from (a census with its own copy of the eligibility rule would drift silently, and only ever
in the direction that under-charges), it deduplicates a candidate re-examined at the next refit, and any
signal that declares a census is routed to a shared ledger bucket rather than to its own.
