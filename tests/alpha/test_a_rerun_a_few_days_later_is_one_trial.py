"""Caliber ④ (operator ruling, 2026-09-14): `range_end` folds to a policy-set granularity.

Q4c measured what the caliber question actually turned on.  After the Q2 rollback the `mined` bucket
held 2,073 rows over 676 expressions in four contexts, and two of the three axes were confounded -
`construction` moved only with `symbols`, and `range_end` spanned 2-3 days out of five years and eight
months.  Scoring the same 676 expressions on both universes gave a joint `N_exact` of 641 against a
single-universe 337, a ratio of 1.90: **the second universe is very nearly a full second look, so
cross-universe re-charges stay charged.**  Only the `range_end` axis collapses.

That half needs no simulation.  A signal's value at bar t depends on data up to t, so the same
expression, same symbols, same construction, evaluated over a range that ends a few days later
produces an **identical stream on the shared index** - the extra ~48 bars are the only difference.
Identical streams cannot be two independent looks; the added independence is exactly zero.  Arithmetic,
not an estimate.

**But the argument does not say "drop `range_end`".**  It holds for any difference, including two more
years - and two more years really is a second look, because the Sharpe it records is a different
number.  So the rule needs a granularity, a granularity is a threshold, and R10 says thresholds live in
`Policy`.  `beidou_alpha` is the lower layer and cannot import it, so the value is threaded through as
a REQUIRED keyword: a caller that forgets it fails to call rather than silently getting the old
behaviour, which is the invisible-default shape this repo has been bitten by twice.

The granularity is not load-bearing on this ledger - 7, 14 and 30 days all give `mined` 1,559,
`tsmom` 101, `flow` 43 - so 7 is chosen as the one that folds least among those that fold the case at
all.  Bucket boundaries mean two runs a day apart can straddle one and not fold; that is a known
imperfection and it errs toward charging MORE, which is the direction a denominator may be wrong in.
