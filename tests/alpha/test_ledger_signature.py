"""DL-K1: what makes two runs the same trial, and where the one ledger lives.

KILL-Q5 named two holes in the accounting protocol.

The first is the signature.  `(param_key, range_start, range_end, symbols)` cannot see the
construction the weights were built under, the overlay that was applied to them, *which* symbols
those were rather than how many, or which search space a mined id was drawn from.  Two runs that
differ in any of those are different trials, and the ledger was folding them into one - charging the
DSR denominator less than the selection actually cost.

The second is the ledger's address.  It was `Path(--out) / "trials.jsonl"`, and `--out` is a flag
people pass for ordinary reasons: point the reports somewhere else and the run is charged to a fresh,
empty ledger.  That is not a loophole anyone has to intend, which is what made it worth closing.  The
address is now fixed, and moving it takes an environment variable whose only possible purpose is to
not be charged.

C-P6 is the constraint on all of it: this changes what FUTURE runs cost.  Nothing here reaches back
and re-prices an archived report, so tsmom's N=125 is the same number tomorrow as it was yesterday.
