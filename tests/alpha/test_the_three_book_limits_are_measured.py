"""The three §3 limits, each measured on its own, against numbers that are not the code's own.

Three of the four conditions on `validated -> booked` were a literal `True` / `0.0` / `0.0` in
`beidou_governance/replay.py` from Phase 0 until today, and the reason was never that the arithmetic
was hard - it was that no book report carried the fields, so there was nothing to read.  These tests
are what stops that from being true again: one per number, on inputs small enough to check by hand,
plus one that reads the numbers back off an ARCHIVED book report so the turnover definition is pinned
against a real 49,096-bar run rather than against a fixture that agrees with it by construction.
