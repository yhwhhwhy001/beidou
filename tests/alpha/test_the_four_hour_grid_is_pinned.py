"""chanlun `level: "4h"` groups 01-05, not 00-04, and that is a decision rather than a bug.

The panel is indexed by bar OPEN time.  `resample(rule, label="right", closed="right")` therefore puts
the 01:00/02:00/03:00/04:00 opens - real time 01:00 to 05:00 - into one group stamped 04:00.  Causally
that stamp is the correct one: the group's last input closes at 05:00, and 05:00 is exactly where the
information set of the DECISION bar 04:00 ends, so the `ffill` onto the 1h grid can never land a value
on a bar that predates its own inputs.

The price is that this is not Binance's 4h candle (00-04, 04-08, ...), so a `level: "4h"` structure
compared against a 4h chart will disagree, and the disagreement will be in the grid rather than in the
algorithm.  chanlun is not enabled, so nothing is being traded on it either way.

This file exists because the obvious "fix" - `label="left", closed="left"` - is a one-word edit that
looks like a tidy-up and is a strategy change plus a one-bar look-ahead.  Pinning the grouping makes
that edit fail a test that says so, instead of quietly re-deciding a signal.  Changing the grid on
purpose means changing this file in the same commit, with the evidence.
