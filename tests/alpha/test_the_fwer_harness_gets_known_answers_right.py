"""The Q4b harness is checked against families whose answer is known before it judges one that is not.

`scripts/q4b_liji_fwer.py` decides whether Li & Ji's N_eff gives this gate its declared 5%.  A verdict
from an unvalidated instrument is worth nothing, and this round has already had to write that sentence
about `effective_trials` itself - so the instrument gets the same treatment.

Two families with known answers:

* **676 independent columns.**  N_eff must come out at 676, and the gate at n = 676 must reject at
  alpha, because that is the case the gate's own null describes.  This is the only check that can
  catch a sampler that is silently wrong.
* **676 columns spanning 20 directions.**  Correlation can only make the maximum smaller, so the gate
  at the RAW count must reject at most alpha.  A control above alpha means the sampler is wrong and
  nothing else it prints may be read - which is why the script refuses on it rather than reporting it.

The second family also shows why the question was worth asking.  Li & Ji returns 32 there, and a gate
built on 32 rejects about 38% of the time - the maximum of 676 unit-variance marginals is nothing like
the maximum of 32, however few directions they span.  That is not a prediction about the real matrix,
whose collinearity is far milder; it is the reason the real matrix has to be measured rather than
assumed.
