"""Two entries sharing an id must fail loudly, and `strategy_targets` must pair by id rather than by position.

`strategy_targets` used to walk `zip(self.entries, strategy_scores(...).values(), strict=True)`.  The
order really does match - both come from one pass over `self.entries` - and `strict=True` really does
catch a length mismatch.  What it cannot do is say WHY: a dict keyed by id collapses by one when two
entries share an id, so the first symptom of a duplicated id is a zip complaining about lengths, and
every entry after the duplicate has meanwhile been paired with another strategy's scores.

So: pair by id, and refuse the duplicate at both doors it can come through - `parse_registry` for a
registry read from disk, `AlphaModel.__post_init__` for a model assembled any other way (a `replace`,
a miner, a test).  Both messages name the id, because "duplicate strategy id" without one sends the
reader back to the YAML to diff it by eye.
