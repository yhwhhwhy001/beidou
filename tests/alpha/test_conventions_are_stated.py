"""Two undeclared conventions, declared (2026-09-08 audit).

Both were correct and neither was written down, which in this repository is the failure mode with its
own entry in the log: a fact that is true and unstated reads exactly like an assumption nobody checked.

* `sharpe` has no risk-free term.  At 30% annualised volatility a 4% rate is worth about 0.13 of
  Sharpe - larger than several effects this repository has re-run whole validations over - and the
  book's equity sits at the venue as margin, so the opportunity cost is real.  The number stays as it
  is (changing it would break comparability with every archived report); what changes is that it says so.
* `backtest`'s module docstring called `open_to_close` "conservative".  That is true of the entry price
  and false of the holding return: the convention silently drops close_t -> open_{t+1} on every held
  bar, worth 2.36% of total absolute price movement, and re-earning it costs -0.029 OOS Sharpe on the
  shipped book - the dropped component is adverse, not favourable.

Asserted rather than trusted, the same way `test_selection_gate` pins "short-sample guard": a paragraph
nothing reads is a paragraph that gets deleted by the next person who tidies the file.
