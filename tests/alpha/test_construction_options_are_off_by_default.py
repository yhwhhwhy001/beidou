"""Block 4's two construction options (#35 GARCH, #48 HRP): off by default, causal, and separable.

Every test here answers one of three questions, and they are deliberately not mixed:

* does turning the option OFF leave the shipped construction untouched (bit for bit, not "close")
* is the option CAUSAL
* does the estimator do what its name says on data where the answer is known

Whether either helps on 1h crypto perpetuals is not a question a unit test can answer, and this file
does not pretend to: that is measured in `scratchpad/block4_garch_hrp_increment.py` and judged against
the pre-registration in RESEARCH_LOG.
