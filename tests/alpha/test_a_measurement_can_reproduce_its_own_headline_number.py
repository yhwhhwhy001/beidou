"""Q4b: the measurement must persist what would let someone disagree with it.

The 2026-09-14 `--measure` run cost 45 minutes and wrote one scalar: `effective_trials: 193.0`.
Everything that could be used to check that number - the correlation structure it came from - was
discarded when the process exited.  Validating Li & Ji against this ledger therefore needs the 45
minutes spent again, and that is not a limitation of the estimator, it is a defect in the artefact.

It is also the exact failure this whole round has been about.  `all_trials`'s docstring says it best:
a number nobody can see is a number nobody can argue with.  A number that cannot be recomputed from
the artefact that reports it is the same thing one step further on.

So two changes, and the second is what makes the first mean anything:

* `effective_trials_from_correlation` - Li & Ji's count taken from a correlation matrix rather than
  from a returns matrix, so the estimator has ONE implementation and the artefact's matrix feeds the
  same code the run used.  `effective_trials` becomes the returns-shaped front door to it.
* `--measure` persists the correlation matrix beside the report, with its sha256 and shape recorded.

The assertion that matters is the round trip: feed the persisted matrix back in and get the reported
number.  Anything weaker would let the two drift, which is how a stored threshold outlives the rule
that made it (KILL-Q3, one floor down).
