"""A re-authorised round that reproduces its predecessor bit-for-bit bought nothing, and must say so.

2026-09-09 09:50Z.  `research mine` ran the same space as 08:29Z under `--reauthorize`, and the
reason recorded in the artefact was specific and checkable: 90 candidates (oi 54 + lsr 36) had
`errored` because `Panel._map` dropped the metrics columns, "已在 3b49af8 修复" - so re-run them.

The run charged 658 rows.  It scored the same 568 candidates, errored on the same 90, against the
same `dataset.digest` and the same baseline, and every one of the 658 Sharpes came out identical.
The fix it invoked had not reached this path; the real one (`f4ea9de`) landed that evening and the
17:25Z round is what collected the 90.  So the middle round is a replay that its own authorisation
says should not have been one, and nothing in the artefact says it failed to achieve its purpose.

That is measurable at the moment the run ends, from two files already on disk, and it is the
difference between "we paid 658 rows for 90 scores" and "we paid 658 rows for nothing".  Q7's
precedent ("复原一份已经付过费的搜索……没有产生任何新的选择自由度") turns on exactly this
distinction, and today an operator can only reach it by diffing two reports by hand.

Reported, never refused: whether a reproduced round stays charged is a governance ruling, not this
function's call.  It only has to be impossible to miss.
