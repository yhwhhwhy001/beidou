"""The evidence gate compares the overlays too, not only the signal params and the portfolio (2026-09-08 audit).

The live book is four layers - signal, sleeve, exit overlay, book guards - and the report the registry
cites described the first one.  `guards=` reached exactly one of sixteen `run_backtest` call sites and
`apply_exits` exactly one, neither of them in `research validate`, so the gate had nothing to compare:
`stop_loss 6 / take_profit 6` and `daily_loss_pause -0.05` ran live against evidence that never saw them.

Same contract as `construction_problems`, for the same reason: a report that predates the field is
skipped rather than refused, or nothing in flight today could start.  What is NOT skipped is a report
that says the layer was off while the loop runs it - that is a divergence, not an absence.
