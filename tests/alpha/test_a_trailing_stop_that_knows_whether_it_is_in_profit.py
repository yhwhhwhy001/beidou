"""EXP-AE3: the activation threshold the operator's 「移动止盈」 needs, which this repository did not have.

`trailing_stop` measures the retracement from `extreme`, and `_enter` initialises `extreme` to the
ENTRY price.  So for a long, `extreme >= entry` on every bar and therefore `retrace >= adverse` on
every bar: today's trailing stop fires while the position is still LOSING, and it gets there before
`stop_loss` does.  That is the mechanism behind two things already written down - `config/live.demo.yaml`'s
"a future trailing experiment must take `k_tr > 6`", and the measurement that `sl0/tr4/tp0` and
`sl4/tr4/tp0` produce an identical 1.6132 over an identical 904 exits, i.e. `k_tr <= k_sl` turns
`stop_loss` into dead code.  It is why EXP-AE1's third cell (`trailing_stop` 2.0) was withdrawn on
2026-09-17 rather than run: it would have scored a book whose stop was silently off.

`trailing_activate` changes exactly one thing: the rule may not fire until the position has been that
far in profit.  The two tests that carry the whole argument are the pair below on an identical price
path - the same `sl 6 / tr 2` that today exits at -2 sigma exits at -6 sigma once armed at +1.5, which
is `stop_loss` doing its job again.

What it does NOT promise: a profitable exit.  Armed at +a and trailing by b > a still leaves below
entry, and the third test pins that so nobody reads the name as a guarantee.

Shipped at 0.0 - arm from entry, today's behaviour - and `docs/RESEARCH_LOG.md` 2026-09-08 recorded
this shape as "仍未实现、未测".  It is now implemented and still untested: EXP-AE3 is the evidence,
and it cannot run before 2026-10-13T19:00Z (the freeze, K-EX14).
