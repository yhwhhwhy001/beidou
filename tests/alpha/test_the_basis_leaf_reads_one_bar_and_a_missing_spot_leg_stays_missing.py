"""DL-D5, block 2: the basis leaf, the family it heads, and the two refusals that make it safe to search.

Four claims, each with a specific defect behind it.

SAME BAR.  `Basis` is `log(perp_close / spot_close)` on one bar and reads nothing else, so truncating the
panel cannot change a value that survived the truncation.  The rival - "the latest spot bar available" -
is what `metrics.align_to_bars` does correctly for open interest and what would price XMRUSDT's halted
listing (spot 118.70 since 2024-02-20, perp 503.83) at +324% for two years.

MISSING IS MISSING.  166 of 528 perpetuals have no spot leg.  A NaN that becomes a 0.0 anywhere on the
way to a score is a symbol trading at parity with a spot market that does not exist.

LOUD WHEN UNWIRED.  A panel with no spot at all raises where the node is written.  `research mine`
enumerated the DL-D4 metrics leaves against a panel loaded without metrics for two whole rounds; the 90
`ExprError`s per round are the only reason that was findable at all.

RISK-G3 BINDS ON LIVE, NOT ON THE PANEL.  `beidou_live.composition.load_panel` builds the RESEARCH panel
too, so a refusal there would make this family unminable rather than untradeable.  The refusal is at
startup, on the strategies that declare `needs_spot`.
