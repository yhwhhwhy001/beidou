"""P30: a per-bar gross cap on a non-main book, applied before its fraction (2026-09-12).

P21 rejected `mined_594a12f9307a15d9` on one check of six - `oos_mdd_worsening` 4.98pp against a 1pp
gate - and diagnosed it as construction rather than parameter: the sleeve's mean absolute exposure is
1.372 against tsmom's 0.859, so a third of that sleeve is not a third of the main book's risk budget,
and "drawdown follows exposure rather than the budget".

The cap is deliberately narrow, and each of the three tests below pins one of the three properties the
pre-registration fixed BEFORE any P&L was computed:

* it applies to non-main books only (the main book's own gross is `max_gross`'s job, and the two must
  not stack);
* it applies BEFORE the fraction, so `fraction` keeps the meaning D-019 claims for it - a proportion of
  the main book's risk budget - instead of quietly becoming a proportion of an arbitrarily sized book;
* off is off.  `sleeve_max_gross = 0` must leave every weight bit-identical, because this change ships
  into a loop that is holding positions: F1 of the pre-registration, and the same shape as the F1 that
  guarded `book_weights` reaching disk four days ago.
