"""`flow`'s volume-expansion warm-up: the aggressive fill is now a named knob, and its default is today.

`expansion` is in (0, 1] and multiplies the imbalance, so `fillna(1.0)` scores the un-warm bars as
though volume had expanded as much as it ever can - the upper bound, not a neutral value.  Two facts
have to be held at once, and this file asserts both rather than picking the comfortable one:

* the default is unchanged and bit-identical, because `flow_short` is ENABLED and the live loop
  re-presents the head of a sliding 1,442-bar window every cycle, where `scores_to_targets` can carry
  a value forward to the bar actually being traded;
* the fill IS reachable under the shipped registry, but not through the door the review named.
  `window` 168 against `volume_window` 48 closes the warm-up head entirely; measured on the
  point-in-time panel (205 symbols x 49,937 bars), all 4,284 bars it reaches come from
  `volume_ratio`'s other NaN - a trailing 48-bar mean volume of exactly zero - so what is being
  scored as "maximum volume expansion" is a symbol that has stopped quoting.  238 of the 4,284 are
  inside the eligible/point-in-time mask.

Adopting `None` is therefore an operator decision with its own evidence, and this file's job is to make
sure it is available as a config edit and that choosing it is visible rather than silent.
