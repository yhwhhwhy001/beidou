"""Shuffle every bar after a cutoff, and no weight before it may move - one layer above the signals.

The signals already have this test (`test_signal_suite.py::test_signals_are_causal_and_bounded`,
`test_causality.py::test_tsmom_is_causal`).  Nothing had it for what sits on top of them: the stage-1
divisor and the EWMA covariance scalar, both caps and the no-trade band's recursion (`build_weights`),
the sleeve sum (`combine_books`), the cross-sectional reference population (`AlphaModel`), and the
guard replay inside `run_backtest`.  That is the most path-dependent code in the package - three
recursions (covariance, band, equity) and one population chosen bar by bar - and it was on the list
twice: the 2026-09-05 audit priced it at S
(`docs/analysis/2026-09-05-system-quality-deep-analysis.md` §6.3), and the 2026-09-23 checklist
carries it as G7 (`docs/analysis/2026-09-23-external-prompt-checklist-vs-beidou.md`).

What every test here holds fixed, and why none of it is a look-ahead:

* The START of every frame.  Each recursion is anchored on the frame's first row: the covariance
  starts from zero, `ewm_vol` waits `vol_halflife` bars, the band starts flat, the replay's equity
  starts at 1.0.  Moving the start moves the warm-up, which is D-033's question and already has its
  own tests (`test_round6_hold_and_warmup.py`, `test_refit_boundaries_are_a_calendar_not_an_offset.py`).
  Only the future is perturbed here, so a difference can only have come from the future.
* The INDEX.  `refit_boundaries` puts HRP's re-clusters on a calendar anchored at the epoch, and
  measures the bar width as the modal gap of the WHOLE index - it reads future timestamps, by design:
  the grid is the calendar, not the data.  `_shuffle_future` perturbs values and never a timestamp.
* The execution lag.  `run_backtest` executes at t+1 what was decided at t, so the guarded book is
  compared THROUGH the cutoff bar, and the per-bar outcomes, which read the bar's own return, only
  before it.  The last test in this file shows what the inclusive bound catches that the other misses.
* `summary()`.  A Sharpe, a count of capped bars and `min_margin_buffer` are full-sample aggregates by
  definition, so nothing here compares a summary.  Every comparison is bar by bar.

Bit for bit, not "close".  pandas 3's `assert_frame_equal` defaults to rtol 1e-5, under which a leak
worth 1e-9 of a weight passes; `_bit_for_bit` asks for `check_exact` and then for the same 64 bits.

The construction is the live profile's with two numbers moved, not the live profile itself - see
`_construction` for the measurement that forces it.

What one cutoff cannot see, measured.  A leak that reaches one bar ahead touches exactly one compared
bar, the last before the cutoff, and shows only if that bar is sensitive to it.
`scratchpad/g7_planted_leaks.py` plants fourteen such leaks, one at a time, in a copy of the package,
and eleven turn this file red.  The three that pass each need something this cutoff's last bar lacks:

* the gross cap read through a centred window needs a bar under the 0.6 that four capped weights
  reach, and the bars around the cutoff all sit on it (caught at 30 of 79 cutoffs);
* the participation instrument read at the execution bar needs an order on the cutoff bar, and the
  pause holds every weight there (2 of 79);
* a scoring population one bar ahead needs a breakout that clears the entry threshold on the last bar.
  The one there scores 0.018 against 0.05, so the hold keeps the previous target whatever the
  population says (10 of 79).

A leak that reaches k bars ahead has k compared bars to show on.  Sweeping all 79 cutoffs would buy
these three, and costs about 40 s against this file's one second - a price to decide, not a default.
