"""q10 must come OUT of the evidence run, not be pasted next to it.

The adopted decay rule (report 4.2 Ⅰ) compares the live 30-day Sharpe to the backtest's distribution of
same-length windows.  That quantile is only meaningful for the construction it was computed under, so
computing it once and writing it into the registry by hand would go stale, silently, at the next
construction change - the D-026 failure this repository has already had twice.  Emitting it from
`walk_forward.summary()` ties it to the evidence by construction: a new evidence run carries a new q10,
and a construction with no evidence has no q10 rather than a stale one.
