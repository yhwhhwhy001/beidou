"""DL-R3: the acceptance the FWER gate shipped without, and the N_eff it owes.

KILL-R25 made the objection that the 2026-09-06 gate never answered: its own acceptance condition
was "125 independent nulls clear the gate at most 5% of the time", and that is true *by
construction* - the threshold solves ``Phi(x)^N = 1 - alpha`` for exactly that null.  The ledger's
trials are not independent (24 exact duplicates and a long tail of near-duplicates), so the test
that means something is the correlated one, and the property it should establish is the one the
gate's docstring claims: with correlated trials the gate is **conservative**, not merely correct.

``effective_trials`` is the other half of the debt.  It is reported, never gated - substituting an
N_eff for N would *lower* the bar, and lowering a bar on the strength of an estimator nobody has
validated on this ledger is the mistake this whole round exists to stop.  Reported, it lets a
reader see how much of the search cost is duplication.
