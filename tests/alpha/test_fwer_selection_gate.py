"""KILL-Q3 / F2: the D-028 gate is a quantile of the null's maximum, not its expectation.

`oos_selection_threshold` returned ``expected_max_sharpe`` - E[max of N nulls].  A single
noise curve exceeds the expectation of the maximum roughly half the time, so as a gate it
admits noise at ~43.5%, measured on the shipped report's own null.  The fix is one line of
mathematics: solve Phi(x)^N = 1 - alpha for x, which is the alpha-level family-wise bound.

`expected_max_sharpe` itself is deliberately NOT changed - the DSR uses it as a benchmark
Sharpe, where the expectation is the right object.  Only the gate moves.
