"""DL-S51: the properties that make a Chan implementation honest rather than merely plausible.

Chan theory usually reads the future, and it does it in a specific way: the textbook draws its pens
and segments with the whole chart visible, so a structure revised at bar 900 silently repaints the
picture at bar 400.  The shared suite's causality test would have missed it here until KILL-AR-15 was
fixed, because this signal's 720-bar warmup was longer than that test's whole comparison window - the
scores it compared were NaN against NaN.

So the properties below are about WHEN a value may appear and WHAT the three vocabulary items mean,
not about whether the signal is any good.  Whether it is any good is `research validate`'s question
and its answer was pre-registered as "probably not, and if it is, probably tsmom rewritten".
