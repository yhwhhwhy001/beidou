"""676 candidates are 61 shapes, and nothing could say the latter.

The same failure `distinct_hypotheses` closes one floor down, asked of the search space instead of the
ledger: every count beside it counts candidates, so no artefact could say how much of a 676-wide space
is one mechanism written with different constants.

What this is NOT is the thing operator ruling 2026-09-14 (Q4) refused.  That ruling turns on a ranked
shortlist - "free to look" is a multiple-testing hole with a flag on it, "free to count" is not.  A
shape histogram names no candidate, carries no Sharpe and ranks nothing, which is the side of that
line `effective_trials` already sits on.

Every expression below is taken from the enumerator by its own text rather than rebuilt here: a
fixture assembled by hand tests the constructor this file guessed at, not the space that ships.
