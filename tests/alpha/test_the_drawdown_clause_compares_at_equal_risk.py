"""Operator ruling 2026-09-14 (Q3): D-018's drawdown clause compares two books at the same risk.

D-018 asks what a sleeve ADDS, and prices it by subtracting the main book's out-of-sample drawdown
from the total book's.  Those two books do not carry the same risk.  Measured 2026-09-07 on the
`594a12f9` sleeve at fraction 1/3: adding a stream correlated 0.236 took the book's annualised vol
from 32.24% to 35.66%, +10.6%.  **Any sleeve that can add Sharpe adds vol, and therefore adds
drawdown**, so the 1pp allowance was being charged against a bigger book than the one it was written
for.  Scaling the total back to the main book's vol kept the Sharpe gain intact (+0.288, to the digit)
and moved the drawdown cost from +4.27pp to +1.87pp.

That was recorded as a finding about the RULE, not about that candidate - and deliberately left
unexecuted, because the candidate had just failed and changing a rule you have just failed is the
thing this apparatus exists to refuse.  The ruling is now made on its own terms.

**It applies to later candidates only, and that is enforced structurally rather than by a date.**  The
equal-risk number exists only in reports that carry it; `marginal_checks` reads it when it is there and
the raw difference when it is not.  So no archived verdict moves, and nothing has to remember a
cut-off.  It also does not rescue `594a12f9`: at equal risk that sleeve still costs +1.87pp against a
1pp allowance, which is why the ruling could be made without deciding its case.
