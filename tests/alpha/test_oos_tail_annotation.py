"""KILL-Q2 / F1+F3: a validation report must say when its "OOS" had nothing to select between.

`walk_forward_evaluate` picks the best parameter set per fold on the training slice and
concatenates that set's test slice.  With one grid point - or with every fold choosing the
same point - there is no selection freedom left, so the "walk-forward OOS" is simply the
tail of one full-sample series.  Every tsmom report since 2026-09-04 was of that shape, and
nothing in the artefact said so while the verdict read PASS off the number.

Two annotations, no new gate (the holdout half of the original prescription was withdrawn:
it contradicts the operator's KILL-006 ruling):

* ``oos_is_full_sample_tail`` - true when no fold had a choice to make;
* ``selection_consistent`` + ``best_key_oos_sharpe`` - F3: ``best_params`` is chosen by
  full-sample argmax, while the headline OOS is the fold-selected mixture.  When they differ,
  the shipped configuration's own out-of-sample number is the one a reader wants.
