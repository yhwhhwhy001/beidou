"""Slice invariance for the two re-fitting estimators: the same bar must read the same on any window.

D-033's lesson, applied one layer up.  There it was a live recursion rebuilt every cycle on a request
window that slides one bar, so the latch point was an artefact of where the window started; here the
re-fit cadence was `range(start, n, refit_bars)` and `t % refit_bars == 0`, both counted off row 0 of
whatever frame the caller passed.  The same calendar bar therefore re-fitted in one window and sat
mid-block in another, and the measured consequence was a weight moving 9.69e-4 between a 1,442-bar and
a 1,443-bar request for that reason alone.

Both estimators are OFF by default (`vol_model="ewma"`, `budget_mode="inverse_vol"`; #35 and #48 are
both REFUTED), so nothing here changes a shipped number.  The test exists because the defect is only
expensive if one of them is ever re-opened, and by then the live loop is the thing exhibiting it.

The two comparisons are deliberately not the same strength, and the difference is the point:

* GARCH is EXACT.  Its block is a pure function of the trailing fitting window - parameters and the
  filter state alike - so any frame carrying that window reproduces the block bit for bit.
* HRP is exact in its BOUNDARIES and approximate in its level, because the EWMA covariance it clusters
  on starts from zero on each frame's first row.  The tolerance below is that warm-up and nothing
  else: after k bars the zero start still carries weight 2^(-k/halflife), which is 2^-50 for the
  burn-in this test uses.  A tolerance from a decaying, bounded, named quantity is a different object
  from a discrepancy nobody had measured.
