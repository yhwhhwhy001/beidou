"""`Panel._map` dropped `metrics`, so every slice silently lost the DL-D4 columns.

The cost is measured, not hypothetical.  The 2026-09-09 mine ran right after the metrics archive was
backfilled to 202/205 symbols - the whole reason for that backfill was the DL-D4 open-interest and
long/short leaves - and its report says `outcomes.errored = 90`.  The 90 are exactly the 54 `oi` and
36 `lsr` candidates: **not one metrics candidate has ever been scored, in any round**.

The failure is the shape this repository keeps finding.  `_required_metric` raises loudly, which is
right; the miner catches the raise and counts it, which is also defensible; and the count is all that
reaches the report - so a family that cannot run at all looks like a family that ran and lost.  The
expression itself is fine: on the panel it was handed it evaluates to 50.8% non-null over 205 symbols.
The miner slices, and the slice was a different panel.
