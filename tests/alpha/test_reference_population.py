"""P1-01 / DL-Q1: the cross-sectional reference population is an explicit contract.

The defect this file exists to prevent: ``apply_crowding_modifier`` ranks over
``score.columns`` and ``flow`` demeans over every column, so the population a
cross-sectional operator sees is whatever happens to be in the panel.  Research
builds the panel from every symbol that was *ever* a member (205 on the
point-in-time universe) and applies the membership mask only *after* the scores
exist; the live loop builds it from the symbols it manages that day (15-18).  The
same registry parameters therefore describe two different signals - KILL-027's
shape, on the one modifier that is enabled and on the flow probe's demean.

The contract: ``Panel.reference`` is a boolean frame (bars x symbols) naming the
population.  It restricts ranking / demeaning / breadth ONLY - never the time
series a rolling window reads, because masking the panel itself would make a
symbol that re-enters the universe start its ``rolling(72)`` from NaN while the
live path (which always requests full history) would not.
