"""A bar whose close is missing must not re-anchor the entry, because that turns the stop off.

Found 2026-09-13.  `exit_step`'s guard was `held != 0 and not isnan(entry_price) and price > 0`, so a
NaN close failed `price > 0`, fell PAST the whole exit block, and reached `_enter` - which anchored a
brand-new `ExitState` at the NaN price.  The next priced bar then saw `isnan(entry_price)`, missed the
block again, and ran `_enter` a SECOND time, landing the anchor on the far side of the gap.  The stop
was silently off for the whole segment that followed.

The reproduction below is the one that was measured, with stop_loss = take_profit = 6, sigma_1d = 0.02
and an entry at 100, so one k-unit is 2.0 points.
