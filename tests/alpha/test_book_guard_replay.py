"""M1: the two book-level guards, replayed on the backtest's own equity path.

The test that matters is the first one.  At the shipped vol target neither guard is reachable - 5.6
years of the live book produced a worst UTC day of -3.5% against a -5% pause, and gross never crossed
2.0 - so if the replay is not provably inert there, every number this project has published would move
for no reason.  The rest check that it stops being inert exactly where it should.
