"""Three quantities the book could not say about itself (2026-09-17, layer 0 ④).

Two of them are about the construction rather than about a symbol, and the reason they are worth a
field each is that `vol_target` is the number everything else is argued from:

* **`portfolio_vol`** - the ex-ante annualised volatility of the weights AS THEY LEAVE THE MODEL.
  Stage 2 targets the volatility of stage 1; `combine_books` then sums sleeves without re-targeting
  (a 1/3 sleeve took the 2026-09-07 book from 32.24% to 35.66%, +10.6%), and `max_weight` takes some
  of it back off.  So the vol the loop holds is neither of the two numbers that were measured, and
  nothing recorded it.
* **`clipped_risk_share`** - how much of the requested |weight| the per-symbol cap removed (GAP-AM02).
  At `vol_target` 0.60 the cap binds on 49 of the 95 cycles that carry per-book weights, on BTCUSDT
  and BNBUSDT only, because inverse-vol sizing necessarily hands the largest weight to the calmest
  name.  The count was recorded; the RISK it removes was not - and P13's "scaling every weight by k
  leaves net Sharpe exactly unchanged, so the dial carries no alpha" holds only while the cap is not
  binding, which is the reading the count cannot supply.
* **`symbols_settled`** - the live twin of `Panel.settled_symbols`.  `funding_history is not None`
  says a frame was FETCHED; it stayed true for 37 cycles while the modifier was inert (D-042), and a
  symbol with no archive returns a column of zeros the modifier cannot tell from calm funding.

All three are observability.  The extraction that makes the second one exact - `vol_targeted`, which
`build_weights` now calls - is held to bit-for-bit reproduction below, because a diagnostic that
rebuilds its own copy of stage 1 and stage 2 can disagree with the book while both look right.
