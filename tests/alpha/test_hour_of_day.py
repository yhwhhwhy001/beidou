"""#8, block 2: this symbol's own mean return in this hour of the UTC day.

The hypothesis is that crypto has a repeating intraday shape - funding settles at 00/08/16Z, sessions
open and close - and that the shape differs by symbol.  Per symbol is the point and also the risk: 24
buckets per name is a lot of parameters chasing a weak effect, which is why it enters as a candidate
rather than as a belief.
