"""The cost stress must vary the half that can vary (2026-09-08 audit).

`cost_stress` scales `turnover_bps` - the taker fee and the slippage assumption together - by
1x / 1.5x / 2x.  Only one of those halves is uncertain: the fee is a contract constant, and the loop
has been measuring the other one.  Scaling the sum answers "what if everything cost more", which is
not the question the venue has been asking; 101 demo fills put price slippage at 5.60 bps against the
model's 2.0, with a 95% interval of [2.01, 9.19].

`cost_stress` itself is untouched: `verdict.decide` reads its `x2` cell and every archived report
carries it, so redefining what x2 means would silently move a gate and break comparability.  This is a
second instrument beside it, anchored on declared slippage levels instead of on a multiplier.
