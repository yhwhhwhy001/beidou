"""A report must say WHICH gate produced its threshold (2026-09-08 audit).

`decide()` compares the OOS Sharpe against `oos_selection.threshold_annual` as stored in the report,
not against a freshly computed one.  When KILL-Q3 replaced E[max] with the (1-alpha) quantile, every
report already on disk kept the number the old gate produced - including the one the registry cites,
written three hours and twenty minutes before the fix landed.  Its stored 1.1446 reproduces
`expected_max_sharpe` to ten decimal places; the current gate gives 1.4684 for the same inputs.  The
headline cleared both, so nothing was wrong with the verdict - but nothing in the artefact said which
ruler it was measured with, and the sha256 pin makes that silence durable.

The fix is one field and one refusal: the threshold carries the name of the function that produced it,
and a report whose gate `decide()` does not recognise cannot PASS on that comparison.
