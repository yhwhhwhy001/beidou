"""R0 / DL-G1: both trial calibers are in the artefact, and exactly one of them decides anything.

"Which N" was the most consequential open choice in the governance rules.  The gate stays the strategy
bucket (`ledger_scope`), because deriving it from the whole library FAILs the incumbent on an honest
grid - that measurement is what settled it - and `effective_trials` can only lower the bar.  But a
report that carries only the caliber that was chosen cannot be used to re-open the choice, so both go
in and the unused one must be provably inert.

This file is the "provably inert" half.  `verdict.decide` reads `oos_selection`; a second block beside
it must not reach the verdict by any path, including the one where someone later "tidies" the two into
a loop over blocks.
