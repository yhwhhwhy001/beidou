"""P1-01 / DL-Q1, part two: research and live must hand the model the SAME population.

Part one (``test_reference_population.py``) gave the cross-sectional operators an
explicit population.  A contract nothing passes is decoration, so this file pins
the two callers:

* research passes the point-in-time membership (intersected with the listing-age
  filter) - the names that were tradable on that bar;
* the live loop passes the universe it manages that cycle.

The existing KILL-027 guard could not see any of this: it feeds both paths the
*same* six-symbol panel, so a signal that silently ranks over extra columns looks
identical on both.  ``test_research_panel_wider_than_the_live_panel_agrees`` is
that test done properly - research gets 30 symbols and a membership mask, live
gets the 6 it manages, and the per-strategy contributions must still agree.
