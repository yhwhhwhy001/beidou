"""P1: `apply_exits` runs a vectorised engine, and it has to be `exit_step` to the last bit.

`exit_step` stays the single source of truth - the live loop calls it per symbol, which is D-012's
"the backtest loop and the live loop call the same exit_step" - so `_run_vectorised` is a SECOND
implementation of the same state machine and is only allowed to exist while this file holds it to
bit-for-bit equality with `_run_stepwise`, weights and events alike.

Bit for bit, not `approx`: the exits evidence is read with a paired ruler whose fold-level standard
error is 0.026-0.086, and a 1e-12 drift in a threshold comparison flips an exit, which moves a whole
segment of the path.  "The same modulo rounding" is a different overlay.

Two nets, because they catch different things.  The hypothesis net searches for the input that makes
the two disagree - prices INCLUDING NaN, targets including NaN and zero, and parameter sets that turn
on trailing, `unit_mode="current"` and `regime_window>0`.  The fixed-seed net is a handful of larger
panels, big enough that the cooldown and the re-entry actually get exercised many times over.
