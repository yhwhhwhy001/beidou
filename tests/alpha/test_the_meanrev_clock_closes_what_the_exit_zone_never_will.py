"""The time stop round 1 asked for on 2026-09-03 and nobody built until 2026-09-17.

`docs/RESEARCH_LOG.md:12` measured meanrev's information and its problem in the same sentence: the 1h
and 4h ICs are significantly positive "但 meanrev 的等名义回测亏损（尾部趋势延续时持仓亏大钱），需要
时间止损与更强趋势门".  :23 and :60 wrote the prescription twice (12-24 bars).  The pit diagnostics on
2026-09-17 reproduced both halves on 206 symbols - 1h cross-sectional IC +0.0159 at NW t 7.64, and an
equal-notional zero-cost Sharpe of -0.62 - and a grep for `max_hold` / `hold_bars` / `time_stop` /
`TimeExit` across the three packages returned nothing.  Fourteen days, two write-ups, zero lines.

What these tests hold is the one property that makes the stop mean anything: **an expired leg stays
flat until the signal lets go.**  The failure mode this signal dies of is a dislocation that keeps
widening, and on such a bar `|z| >= z_entry` is still true - so a stop that emitted one 0.0 and let the
next bar re-open would pay turnover and hold the same tail.
