"""The two properties a six-hour ingest needs, and the measurement that produced both.

The first estimate for this job said 7.1 hours.  It was wrong twice over, and both errors are the kind
a small probe hides:

* it assumed 10 requests a second from the file size, when the path is latency bound - measured 0.06s
  of CPU against 0.58s of waiting per symbol-day, so 1.6/s;
* it was measured on a ten-day store, where `MetricsStore.append` is cheap.  That function reads the
  symbol's whole parquet, concatenates, sorts and writes it back, and `sync_metrics` called it ONCE
  PER DAY - so day k rewrote k x 288 rows and a 2,077-day symbol wrote about 621 million rows to store
  598 thousand.  Quadratic, and invisible at ten days.

So: gather a symbol's days and append once, and fetch several symbols at a time.  Both are asserted
here rather than trusted, because both are the sort of thing a later refactor tidies back.
