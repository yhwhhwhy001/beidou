"""G10: how many days the point-in-time membership table trails today, and why the alert line is 14.

Operator ruling 2026-09-23: the table stays rebuilt by hand, never on a schedule, because a rebuild moves
a BLOCKING field of the dataset manifest and the armed start then refuses until the evidence is re-issued.
What it gets instead is an alert saying how far behind it has fallen.  Research forward-fills the last
row onto every later bar (``membership_at_bars``), so the lag is the number of days run on a frozen pool.

The fixture is the real table, copied 2026-09-23 from ``.beidou/data/membership.parquet`` (sha256
``aced3630...``, rebuilt 2026-09-18 13:17Z, 2,056 daily rows 2021-01-31 .. 2026-09-17).  The 669 columns
that were never a member are dropped: that moves no row, no row size and no entry or exit, so it moves
no number read here.  The second test re-measures from it every number the threshold's docstring cites,
so the constant cannot drift away from its argument without this file going red.
