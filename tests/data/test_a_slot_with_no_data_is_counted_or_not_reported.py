"""O4: `membership_summary` reports dead slots when it can measure them, and says nothing when it cannot.

A 30-day trailing quote volume keeps ranking a symbol that has already stopped quoting, so it can hold
one of `top_n` slots with no data behind it for up to a month.  Measured on the real point-in-time
table: LUNAUSDT's last 1h bar is 2022-05-13 and it stayed a member until 2022-06-10 - 28 refreshes -
and across 2,042 refreshes / 35,899 member-refresh slots there are 109 such slots (0.30%), on 104
refresh days (5.1%), worst 2 of 18-20 over 2026-07-18..22.

0.30% changes nothing.  The point is D-035's: for a family of defect like "N-choose-K degenerates in
some periods", a measured 0.30% and an unmeasured unknown are different answers, and only one of them
can be argued with.  Which is also why the keys are ABSENT rather than 0.0 when no `available` frame is
supplied - a metric that could not be computed must never read as one that passed.
