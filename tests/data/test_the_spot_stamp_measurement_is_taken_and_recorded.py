"""DL-D5, the half that was missing: somebody has to actually TAKE the spot measurement.

`beidou_data.alignment` declared the SPOT contract on 2026-09-09 and `beidou_live.engine.spot_refusal`
held a basis candidate to it, and the gate was shut on every root forever - because nothing produced a
`Verification`.  `beidou_data.spot`'s docstring recorded a real measurement (744/744 bars at lag 0,
0/743 one bar either way) and a sentence in a docstring is not one of these, which is precisely what
`admits_live_signal` is built to be unable to read.

So these tests are about the path from the venue to the gate, and the three places it must stay honest:

* the CHECK is a comparison of two independent renderings (archive vs REST), not of a frame with itself;
* the RECORD carries the counts, and the reader RE-DERIVES the verdict from them rather than believing
  the one written beside them - otherwise a file an operator can edit is a config key in a measurement's
  clothes, and `LiveEngine.__init__` says in as many words that no such thing may open this gate;
* a run that could not measure leaves the gate shut.  "The archive had no month for this symbol" and
  "the offset is fine" are different facts and only one of them is a permission.

The reverse control for the middle one is `test_a_record_whose_own_numbers_refute_it_is_not_admitted`:
edit the counts under a PASS and the gate closes again.
