"""#17 read "research yes, live no" for a plumbing reason, and the mapping under it was wrong too.

`snapshot_metrics` polled `/futures/data/openInterestHist` and nothing else.  That page serves the two
open-interest fields; the four ratio columns come from four OTHER endpoints.  So every row the live
recorder ever wrote had those four as NaN, while the research archive had them - measured 2026-09-12 on
the production store: `sum_open_interest` 0% NaN, all four ratios **100%**.

`metrics_parity` folds columns into a row verdict and skips NaN pairs, so it read `differing: 0` over
data it never compared and the M-011 gate reported parity met.  Agreement on a neighbouring column is
not evidence about this one - `alignment.py` had already written that sentence down; what was missing
was anything that made it false.

The second finding is in the map itself: `longAccount -> count_toptrader_long_short_ratio` is the wrong
quantity.  `longAccount` is the long ACCOUNT SHARE (0.6298 live) and that archive column is a RATIO
(BTCUSDT median 1.5249, range 0.4993-5.3241).  It never fired only because the endpoint that returns
`longAccount` was never polled.  Each mapping below was checked against its own column's archived range
before the change.
