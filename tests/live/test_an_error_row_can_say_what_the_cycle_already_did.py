"""L3's gate asks a question the engine could not write an answer to.

`soak.passes` - the thing `beidou live soak --check` exits non-zero on - is
`no_decision_pass and streak_pass`, and `no_decision_pass` asks whether any ERROR cycle DECIDED
anything.  `soak._decided` looks for five keys: orders, leaving, quarantined, universe_update,
risk_ladder.

The ERROR row `guarded_cycle` writes is a fresh dict built in the exception handler.  It carried none
of the last four and hardcoded `"orders": []`.  So `deciding_errors` was always empty on an
engine-produced record and the gate degenerated to `long_enough and streak_pass`: the no-decision half
could not fail, whatever the loop had done.

The scenario it exists to catch is reachable and ordinary.  `run_cycle` executes orders, and only
THEN runs `_quarantine`, `_summarize` and `_finish_cycle`.  A raise in any of those three leaves
orders on the venue and writes a row that says the cycle placed none.  The fills are in
`trades.jsonl`; it is the cycle row - the one soak reads - that lost them.

`tests/live/test_l3s_criterion_is_ruled.py` asserts the gate works by hand-building
`_cycle(..., "ERROR", orders=[...])`, a row shape `guarded_cycle` could not emit.  The test passed;
the composition was wrong.  That is the seam being placed where the test is convenient rather than
where the domain is, so these tests drive the record from the ENGINE and read it with `soak.score`.
