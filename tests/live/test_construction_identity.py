"""When the fingerprint's own definition grows, that is not the book changing (2026-09-07).

Restart #5 recorded a new construction digest while the book was byte-identical.  The cause was the P22
merge adding a 23rd field, `exits.unit_mode`, to the payload `construction_fingerprint` hashes: adding a
key changes the hash even when every value is unchanged.  Proved by recomputing both field sets against
the same live config - 22 fields reproduce `0dcd044d...` exactly, 23 fields reproduce `b441ea62...`
exactly.  `unit_mode` BELONGS in the fingerprint (it decides what the exit overlay does - KILL-R14's
7-of-18 unplaceable stops are that setting), so the field is right and the silence was the defect:
`evidence_window` dropped from three days to one bar with nothing saying why.

Two mechanisms, decided by the operator on 2026-09-07:

* **A version on the payload**, reported OUTSIDE the hash.  Outside matters: inside, adding the version
  would itself change today's digest, which is the very thing being fixed.  Outside, a reader comparing
  two rows can see whether the FIELD SET differed, and a bump is now the explicit signal that a digest
  change may be definitional rather than real.
* **An alias table**, in code rather than config, so declaring two digests to be the same book takes a
  commit that carries the proof.  History is never rewritten - the old rows keep the digest they were
  written with, and the equivalence lives in the reader.
