"""L1-13: a rehearsal must not write into the book's own state directory.

``beidou live run --dry-run`` shared ``paths.state_dir`` with the real loop, so a rehearsal appended to
the live ``cycles.jsonl`` and rewrote ``heartbeat.json`` and ``state.json``.  The consequences are not
cosmetic: ``live status --check`` reads that heartbeat to decide whether the loop is alive, the daily
report counts those cycle rows, and ``drawdown_state`` reads the equity series they carry.  A rehearsal
could therefore make a dead loop look fresh, or put bars into a metric that is supposed to describe
what the book actually did.

The isolation is DERIVED rather than configured - ``<state_dir>-dry-run`` - for two reasons.  A separate
key would have to be remembered exactly when someone is in a hurry, which is when rehearsals happen; and
the live profile sets ``state_dir`` explicitly, so "honour an explicit setting" would have kept the
original bug for the one profile people actually rehearse.
