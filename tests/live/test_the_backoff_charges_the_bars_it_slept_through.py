"""A bar eaten by the failure backoff reached no counter at all, against a threshold of zero (🟡, 2026-09-13).

`backoff_seconds` is 60s doubling per consecutive error, capped at 3600s, with
`max_consecutive_errors` 12.  From the seventh failure each sleep is a whole 1h bar, and the running
total by then is about 7,380s - two bars.  What those bars left behind: nothing.  The ERROR row belongs
to the bar that FAILED, `wait_for_bar_close` returns the next bar still to close and never mentions the
ones already gone, and `_record_missed_rebalance` - the only thing that moves `missed_rebalances` - was
reachable from the restart path alone.  Meanwhile `config/live.demo.yaml` sets
`max_missed_rebalances: 0` (M-Q03).  A threshold of zero that a whole path cannot move is not a
threshold; it is a number that happens to be zero.

The wiring is one reason constant.  `reports.restart_cost` already charges every SKIPPED row whose
reason is not `ALREADY_REBALANCED_REASON`, so naming the reason in `scheduler.py` is the whole of it -
the reporter is untouched, and this module asserts that by reading through it.
