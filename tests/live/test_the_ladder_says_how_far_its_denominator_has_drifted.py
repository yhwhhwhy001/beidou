"""R8 divides by a pinned path but the positions in its numerator are sized off CURRENT equity.

The reading is `marked / peak - 1`, and `peak` is the running max of `base + the book's own P&L`: it
moves only when the book makes a new high.  The positions whose loss lands in that numerator are
`weight x equity`, and on this account equity also floats with 52.65% BTC collateral.  So the same
percentage move of the book reads scaled by `equity / peak`, and while the book sits below its own
high-water mark that factor has no path back to 1.

Measured over 287 live cycles on 2026-09-14 (`scratchpad/r8_denominator_drift.py`): 1.000 at the
baseline, 1.0154 eleven days later, above 1 on 261 of them.  Small today - a -35% rung firing at -34.66%
of the book's own move - and unbounded in mechanism, which is why it is worth a number rather than a
paragraph.  This is a READING, not a rule: nothing here changes when the ladder fires.
