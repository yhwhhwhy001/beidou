"""One channel, so "delivered" has to mean delivered.

The operator ruled on 2026-09-07 that a second webhook is not wanted and the Lark channel is the one
to make good.  That ruling removes the redundancy DL-L3 was built on and puts all of the weight on a
single return value: `send()` -> True is the only thing standing between the breaker exiting quietly
and a book that stops without saying so (RISK-P1 / KILL-P1).

That return value was `response.status_code < 300`, and the channel is a Lark custom bot, which
answers **HTTP 200 with an error body** when it does not understand the payload:

    {"code": 19001, "msg": "param invalid"}     <- HTTP 200

So a wrong payload shape reads as success.  Nothing in this repository's logs shows an alert ever
being attempted, delivered or rejected, so whether the one channel has EVER worked was unverified at
the time these tests were written - which is the reason they exist rather than a footnote to them.

The rule added here is deliberately narrow: when a provider states its own result, believe the
provider; when it does not, keep trusting the status code.  It can only turn a false success into a
failure, never the reverse.
