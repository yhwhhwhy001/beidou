"""🟠 #2 of the 2026-09-13 review: the one out-of-sample series hangs on a file that could reset itself.

KILL-006 decided against a historical hold-out, and the whole of its reasoning is that live attribution
IS the clean out-of-sample.  M-010's 30-day window therefore rests on `state.json.last_income_ms` being
continuous - and `StateStore.load` answered a file it could not parse with a brand-new `LiveState()`:
no raise, no alert, no row.  Three things follow from that one line, and every one of them is silent:

* `last_income_ms` becomes `None`, `engine._ingest_income` reads `since = ... or now`, the window is
  `[now, now]`, and every income row earned while the loop was down never enters `attribution.jsonl` -
  never, because nothing re-queries an old window.  `decay_watch` sees `live_windows` get SHORTER,
  which is indistinguishable from a loop that simply ran for less time.
* `equity_hwm` restarts at the current equity, so the drawdown reads 0 and D-015's throttle and R8's
  ladder go blind together.
* `exit_states` and `last_contributions` go with them (entry anchors rebuilt from the venue's VWAP,
  D-005's hold seed zeroed once).

And the file could be half-written in the first place: `_atomic_write` was tmp + `replace` with no
fsync, six lines under an `_append` whose comment explains why a ledger row is fsynced.  `replace`
makes the RENAME atomic and promises nothing about the tmp file's contents having left the page cache.

These tests are the three answers: refuse, fsync, and say so when the watermark is gone.
