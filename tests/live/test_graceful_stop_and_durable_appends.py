"""DL-L6 / L1-14: stopping the loop should not be able to tear a record in half.

Two small things that only matter at the moment everything else is going wrong.

*Appends.*  ``_append`` wrote a JSON line to an open handle with no flush and no fsync.  A line is
written in one ``write`` call, so the tear is unlikely - but "unlikely" is not what an append-only
ledger is for, and these are the files the daily report, the attribution and every post-mortem read.
Flush and fsync cost nothing at one line an hour.

*SIGTERM.*  ``launchctl unload`` sends SIGTERM and then SIGKILLs after ExitTimeOut (30s in
deploy/com.beidou.live.plist).  Without a handler the loop dies wherever it happens to be, which
during a cycle means orders sent and not yet recorded.  With one it finishes the cycle it is in and
declines to start another - and the drill in DL-X2's place (`launchctl unload`) is exactly this
path, so it needs to be the tested one.
