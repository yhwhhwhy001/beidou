"""`inputs.dropped` had no reader anywhere in the tree, and the default was to flatten (2026-09-13 🟡).

The path: `closed_bars` hands back an empty frame or a single bar for a symbol - a delisting, a public
endpoint wobble, the empty body that follows a rate limit - `model_inputs` puts it in `dropped` and out
of `usable`, the model scores nothing for it, `run_cycle`'s `setdefault` fills it with 0.0, and
`plan_rebalance` reads a target of 0 against an open position as `closing`: one reduce-only market
order for the whole line.  The next cycle the data comes back and the signal opens it again.  The bill
for one missing HTTP response is two crossings of the spread, a reset exit anchor and a cooldown -
and `record["inputs"]["dropped"]` was written into `cycles.jsonl` where nothing read it.  D-041 /
DL-Q0's exact shape: written down, no reader.

Flattening a real delisting is RIGHT, so the change is not "stop flattening".  It is that the loop can
now tell the two apart, and the only thing that can tell them apart is whether the data comes back.
A single cycle of absence holds last cycle's target; `dropped_after` consecutive cycles is a delisting
and flattens, exactly D-031's `quarantine_after` shape one input over.

This can only REDUCE trading: the weights it touches are ones that had just been set to 0.0, and the
value it puts back is the same symbol's own weight from the previous cycle.  It cannot open a line the
model did not already have on, and a postponed flatten is the same flatten, later.
