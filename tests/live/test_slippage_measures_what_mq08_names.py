"""L1-04: the instrument that judges M-Q08 was pointed at the wrong price and gated too loose.

M-Q08 is one of the two criteria the demo phase is now judged by (report section 9: "demo 的成功判据
不再是 M-010，而是 M-Q08（执行保真）与 M-Q09（无人值守存活）").  Its slippage clause reads
"滑点 ≤ 2× 模型" - the model charges 2 bps, so the bar is 4 bps.  Two things made the instrument
unable to say whether that bar was met:

1. **The reference price was the venue's mark at snapshot time** (`reconciler.take_snapshot` calls
   `venue.mark_prices`, and `plan_orders` carries that number onto the trade row).  The backtest enters
   at the execution bar's OPEN, which in a continuous market is the decision bar's CLOSE - a different
   number, drifting independently, because a mark is an index price and a close is a trade price.
   Measuring against the mark answers "how far from the index did we fill", which is not the question
   M-Q08 asks.
2. **The limit was 10 bps.**  Its own config comment says "against the cost model's 7 bps" - but 7 is
   `turnover_bps`, which bundles the 5 bps taker fee with the 2 bps slippage, while this instrument
   measures price slippage alone (`avg_price` excludes commission).  So a fee-inclusive budget was
   being used to judge a fee-exclusive measurement, at 2.5x the bar M-Q08 actually states.

Together they made the gate structurally unable to fail: the report measured +4.3 bps - outside
M-Q08's 4, comfortably inside the instrument's 10 - and the instrument reported green.

Same family as M-003's missing suite-duration instrument, and worse in one way: that budget had no
instrument at all, this one had an instrument that reported OK while pointed elsewhere.

Rows written before `decision_close` existed are SKIPPED, not silently measured against the mark.
An honest "I cannot measure these 30 fills" is worth more than a precise number for the wrong quantity,
and the house rule is that history is not backfilled.
