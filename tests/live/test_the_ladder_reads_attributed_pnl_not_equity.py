"""DL-G7 / R8: the de-escalation ladder, on attributed P&L, with two cycles of grace.

Before this, `Policy.throttle_scalar` and `drawdown_grace_cycles` had no caller anywhere in the tree.
The rungs were written down, versioned, hashed into `policy_digest()` and recorded every cycle - and
nothing consulted them.  That is the same shape as the four other defects found on 2026-09-09: a thing
that looks like a control and controls nothing.

The other half is which ruler it reads.  52% of this account is non-USDT collateral and 73% of its
measured equity change was repricing, so an equity drawdown can be bitcoin moving while the book sits
flat.  T-G7-3 is the test that says so: equity halves, attribution never moves, the ladder does not
fire.
