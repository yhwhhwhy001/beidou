"""M-Q08's judged slippage splits each fill by the books it traded for (operator ruling 2026-09-23, G9).

Until then the judged reading split thirty days of fills by the NEWEST cycle's books.  Once the probe book
went flat every fill read as the main book's: on 2026-09-23 it judged 119 fills, of which 52 were the main
book's alone, 15 overlaid - at +13.43 bps against the main book's +6.43 - and 52 from cycles written
before `books` existed.  The rule now: a fill belongs to the books that carried its symbol in its own
cycle or the one before, the targets it moved between.  A cycle without `books` cannot say, and a name no
book carried on either side cannot either; neither is guessed.

The cycles and fills below are built in the shape the loop writes (`books` maps strategy to book,
`contributions` maps strategy to symbol scores), and every rule is read through the real functions.
