"""A criterion nobody can read must not report as a pass (2026-09-08 audit).

Every metric in ``risk_budget`` already refuses to invent a number it cannot compute - it returns
``enforced: false`` with a reason.  The summary above them did not carry that through: with no
readable criterion at all, ``risk_budget_status`` returned ``status: OK`` and an empty ``reasons``,
which is what the 2026-09-07 daily report says while M-Q08's slippage instrument had zero usable
fills.  A blind gate and a passing gate looked identical in the one line an operator reads.

Routing is deliberately NOT changed: a criterion that will re-arm on its own once the fills arrive is
the "unactionable standing fact" ``daily_alerts`` was written to keep off the paging path, so it
becomes a notice rather than an alert.
