"""DL-X1's other half: the three functions B1 wrote had no call site.

`tests/live/test_liquidation_observability.py` pins the *arithmetic* - what a distance means, what a
venue zero means, what the margin assertion refuses.  All of it passed while `min_liquidation_distance`
and `margin_mode_problems` were called by nothing at all, so `cycles.jsonl` carried no liquidation
field, startup asserted nothing, and a liquidation's own income row was dropped on the floor.  A tested
function with no caller is not an instrument; this file is the part that makes it one.

Four call sites, one test group each:

* the cycle record carries `min_liq_distance`, foreign positions included - cross margin liquidates the
  account, not the managed subset of it;
* startup refuses an account whose margin mode is not the one the evidence was produced on;
* `INSURANCE_CLEAR` reaches attribution instead of being silently skipped, which is the one income row
  that only ever appears when the thing this whole item is about has already happened;
* `force_orders()` asks the endpoint A-P2 confirmed (verified against demo-fapi 2026-09-07: it answers,
  `limit` caps at 100, and an account that has never been liquidated gets `[]`).
