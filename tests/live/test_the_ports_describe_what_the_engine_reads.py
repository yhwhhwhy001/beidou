"""A protocol that omits what the caller actually reads has stopped describing the contract.

`ports.py` says that in its own words, about `SignalModel`, after mypy saw one of four accesses and
said nothing about the other three.  The `Venue` and `MarketData` ports had the same defect and it was
worse in both directions at once: seven members the engine reads with `getattr` appeared nowhere in
the file, and two that DID appear - `venue_time_ms`, `user_trades` - were declared required while
every call site probed them and fell back.

`getattr(obj, "name", None)` is invisible to a type checker by construction, so the guard cannot be
mypy.  It is this file: the set of names the engine probes must equal the set the ports declare.  Add
a probe without declaring it and the first test fails; declare a member nobody probes and the second
does.
