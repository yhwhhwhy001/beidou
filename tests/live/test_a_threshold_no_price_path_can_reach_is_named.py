"""The `1/sigma` ceiling, on the rule KILL-TL04 did not cover, and the reading that surfaces it.

KILL-TL04 (2026-09-07) derived `retrace <= 1/sigma` for the trailing stop and measured the grid it
empties.  The same bound lands on `stop_loss` through the same price floor, and nothing in the tree
said so until 2026-09-17 - which is why the first live instance was found by an operator reading a
margin figure off a phone app rather than by anything that runs.

The first test pins the ARITHMETIC rather than the reading: a long whose sigma is 0.4517 has a
ceiling of 2.21 sigma, so the shipped `stop_loss` 6.0 cannot fire on it even when the price is driven
to essentially zero.  If that ever stops being true the reading below is measuring nothing, and a test
of the reading alone would still pass.
