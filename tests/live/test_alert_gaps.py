"""Two clauses of the plan that were never delivered, found by reading it against the code.

DL-L3 asks for dedup **and** `run_check.sh` 同源去重 - the same deduplication in the check script.
KILL-R7's evidence was 36 identical FAIL lines over 36 hours, and those came from the HOURLY CHECK
JOB, not from the loop: the check runs as a fresh process every hour, so an in-memory dedup dict is
empty every time and cannot suppress anything.  Dedup that only works inside one long-lived process
is dedup aimed away from the case that produced the finding.

DL-L5's last clause asks that a non-empty `foreign_positions` at startup 告警而非静默 - alert rather
than stay silent.  It logs.  A line in a file nobody reads is what "silent" means to an operator, and
foreign positions are money on the venue the loop has decided not to manage.

# --- The persisted window's clock, and the window's own length -----------------------------------
#
# `test_a_corrupt_state_file_costs_a_duplicate_not_an_alert` above states the invariant: this is a
# cache, and it may never be the reason a message does not go out.  It was tested against a MALFORMED
# file and broken by a well-formed one.  Three ways, all measured on the live machine 2026-09-14:
#
#   * `time.monotonic()` counts from the machine's last boot, and the file outlives boots.  After the
#     2026-09-10 reboot `check-verify` held 630465.2 against an uptime of 374798.0, so `clock() - last`
#     was -255667 - below any window, forever.  24 of 28 `verify` FAIL lines were never delivered and
#     the key had 71 hours left to run.
#   * the same error in the other direction: a previous boot SHORTER than this one writes a number
#     that reads as a recent delivery, and suppresses a real alert for up to a full window.
#   * the window is measured from the moment the provider ANSWERED, while an hourly caller's cadence
#     is measured from when it started.  An 8-second delivery at 11:10Z put the 12:10Z run 3592s
#     later - inside a 3600s window - and dropped the one FAIL that day that needed the operator.
#
# The fourth is the window itself: 3600s against callers that run hourly is a coin flip, and the live
# loop's cycles start a few seconds apart each hour, which lands on the losing side of it.
