"""M-014 was computed every day and read by nothing, and the review it decides is 30 days long.

`probe_correlation`'s own docstring states the criterion: "If the live income series correlate
closely, the sleeve is a tilt and its separate risk budget is a fiction, whatever its own P&L says."
The daily report printed the number in its own section and printed the probe's `days=10.00/30`
countdown in another, and nothing put them on the same line - so the one moment the correlation
decides something (the 30-day review, due 2026-10-02) would arrive with the P&L in front of the
operator and the correlation two sections away.

2026-09-12 reading: tsmom~flow +0.82 over 182 bars.
