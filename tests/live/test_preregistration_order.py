"""DL-K3: a pre-registration written after the result is not a pre-registration.

KILL-R9's shape, mechanised.  The protocol says the hypothesis goes into `docs/RESEARCH_LOG.md`
before the run, and the only thing that made that true so far was somebody remembering to do it - the
ordering was never checked by anything, and P19 already showed what happens when a rule is written
correctly and its coverage is not (five separate misses in one round).

Two orderings, because the strategies come in two kinds:

* a hand-written strategy is registered by name, so the earliest commit to the log mentioning it must
  predate the report;
* a mined candidate cannot be registered by name - its hash is DERIVED from the search, so the hash
  provably cannot exist before the run that produced it.  What must precede it is the search: the
  mine that enumerated the candidate and charged it to the ledger (DL-K2).  Checking the hash against
  the log would be checking that somebody wrote the verdict down, which is not the same claim.
