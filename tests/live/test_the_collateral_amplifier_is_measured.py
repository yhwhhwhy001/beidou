"""The instrument the 2026-09-08 ruling owes.

Audit question 3 asked whether the backtest's equity and the live loop's equity are the same quantity.
They are not: 52% of live equity is non-USDT collateral and the backtest models none, so every weight
is a fraction of a number that moves with BTC.  The operator ruled on 2026-09-08 that the denominator
stays total equity - it is the venue's own margin basis, and under cross margin the collateral really
does absorb losses - which makes the pro-cyclical amplifier a NAMED accepted risk.

D.8 asks that an accepted residual risk carry a compensating control, and this repository's own
recurring lesson is blunter: a threshold nothing measures is just a sentence.  So the amplifier gets an
instrument.  It measures and changes nothing, and it must never page: it is a standing fact about the
account, not an event.

The property that matters most is the last one.  Reporting the repriced share is safe; subtracting it
would silently produce the USDT-denominator book the operator did not choose.

2026-09-09 audit, and the reason this file changed.  Until today the first test here ended with
``assert 0.72 < drift["repricing_share"] < 0.74`` under the heading "the live shape".  It was not the
live shape: it is a division between two numbers hard-coded three lines above it, so it could only ever
restate arithmetic the previous two assertions had already fixed.  What it DID do was publish a level -
the governance plan's §12 cites "23 周期里 73% 是重估" and `risk_budget.py`'s own docstring repeated it -
and that level was never a property of anything.  Measured on the live record on 2026-09-09 the same
instrument reads 1.0682 over 47 cycles: equity +36.41 while the book was DOWN 2.48, so more than all of
the rise was collateral.

So the assertions here now pin what cannot drift: the decomposition is an identity, and the share is
classified by DIRECTION rather than by level.  The direction that matters has a definitional boundary
and not a calibrated one - above a share of 1 the account's equity sign no longer tells you the book's
P&L sign, which is precisely the thing RISK-G11 exists to make visible.  Widening the old interval to
include 1.07 would have been the other move available today, and it would have been the wrong one: it
keeps a level nobody can justify and merely moves it to wherever the account happens to sit.
