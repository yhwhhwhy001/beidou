"""D-033: exactly one no-trade band per path, and live's reference is the venue's real position.

The band's rule is "keep what you have unless the change is big enough".  In a backtest the model's
own output *is* the position, so ``apply_no_trade_band`` is the position recursion.  Live, the
position belongs to the venue and ``plan_rebalance`` applies the same rule against it, so the model
applying it too suppressed the change twice - against a reference that was not the book, and rebuilt
each cycle over a request window that slides by one bar.

The claim these tests hold to account: with the band left to the rebalancer, the live position path
is the *same recursion* the backtest's banded weights describe.
