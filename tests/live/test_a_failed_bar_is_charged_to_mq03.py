"""The bar a cycle FAILED on reached no counter either, against the same threshold of zero (🟡, 2026-09-16).

`test_the_backoff_charges_the_bars_it_slept_through` closed one half of this in 2026-09-13: the bars
the failure backoff *sleeps through* now write a SKIPPED row and are charged.  The other half was left
open, and its own docstring says so - "the ERROR row belongs to the bar that FAILED".  Nothing charges
that bar, so `max_missed_rebalances: 0` still cannot see the commonest outage this loop actually has.

What it costs, measured on the armed loop 2026-09-16.  A failed cycle does not retry inside its bar:
`backoff_seconds()` sleeps 60s and `wait_for_bar_close` then returns the NEXT bar, so with a 1h
interval the failed bar is simply gone.  Four bars since 2026-09-08 have no successful cycle at all -
2026-09-09T10:00, 09-14T20:00, 09-15T08:00, 09-16T04:00 - every one of them a transport error on the
path to the venue.  M-Q03 reported zero misses on each of those days.  The only instrument that saw
them was `live status`'s 95% success rate, which over ~25 attempts a day tolerates exactly one lost
bar per day - a different number from the zero written in `config/live.demo.yaml`, reached by nobody's
decision.

And it is not "one rebalance skipped": the exit overlay never rests an order at the venue, it is
evaluated inside the cycle and closed with MARKET reduceOnly.  A lost bar is an hour with no stop
check.

Charged on the READER side, for the reason the reporter already gives for counting rows rather than
the engine's running total: the counter resets on restart, and these outages are exactly when restarts
happen.  Reading rows also charges the four bars already in the record.
