"""P1-01 live wiring + DL-Q0: the loop declares its population, and says which registry it loaded.

Two defects, one restart:

* P1-01 - the engine handed the model whatever symbols it had fetched, so the
  cross-sectional population was an accident of the request rather than the
  universe.  ``run_cycle`` must pass ``reference_symbols`` explicitly.
* DL-Q0 / KILL-Q15 - the process builds its model once at startup and never
  reloads it, so editing ``config/alpha_registry.yaml`` changes what the *file*
  says without changing what the loop *trades*.  On 2026-09-04 that gap opened
  for real: the loop started at 17:21Z, the commit that re-enabled the funding
  crowding modifier landed at 20:03Z, and for the next 93 cycles the registry
  said ``crowding_window: 72`` while the process ran 0 - with no instrument
  anywhere able to say so.  Every cycle must record the digest of the registry
  it is actually running.
