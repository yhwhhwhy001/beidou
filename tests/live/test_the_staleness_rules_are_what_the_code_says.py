"""`staleness.RULES` is a claim about five other modules, so it gets a test rather than trust.

The prose it replaces had already gone stale once: `exits.py` still said `stale_carry_bars` was "not
yet in `construction_fingerprint`" after v6 put it there.  A table of settings that nothing checks
becomes wrong the same way, just more legibly, so each row is joined to the code it names.

The divergence itself is pinned too - not to bless it, but so that closing it is a decision somebody
takes rather than something that drifts shut and nobody notices.
