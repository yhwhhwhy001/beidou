"""`scale_orders_to_margin` charged a flip for margin it releases (2026-09-13 review).

A long-into-short order is not `reduce_only` - it ends on the other side - so the whole quantity,
`|current| + |target|`, counted towards `needed`.  The `|current|` half closes the standing position
and gives margin back.  `needed` was therefore too large, and an account that could fund the book got
its risk-adding orders shrunk pro-rata for nothing.

Fixed directly rather than behind a knob, because this function is a PRE-CHECK: its reason for
existing is "instead of letting the venue reject them one by one (-2019)".  Correcting an
over-estimate only makes the pre-check agree with the venue; it can never send more than
`plan_rebalance` already decided, and the venue's own margin check is still the backstop.  The
direction of the change is less shrinking, never more.
