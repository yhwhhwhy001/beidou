"""AC-L2: twelve consecutive failures, and what the operator is left with.

`test_breaker_stops_cleanly.py` pins `breaker_stop` in isolation - it alerts, it raises the clean
signal, it stays loud when nothing accepted the alert.  None of that says the loop ever REACHES it.
The acceptance criterion is a scenario, and it names three things the unit tests do not cover:

* the counter actually reaches `max_consecutive_errors` and trips there, not earlier and not never;
* the process exits **0**, which is a CLI-layer branch - and under `KeepAlive.SuccessfulExit=false`
  (verified empirically 2026-09-07: exit 0 ran once in 55s, exit 3 ran six times) that is the
  difference between a stopped book and L1-03's relaunch-into-the-same-wall every 60 seconds;
* a successful cycle resets the count, or twelve failures scattered over a month would stop the book.

The third is not in the plan's wording and is the one worth having: a breaker that counts forever is
a breaker that eventually fires for no reason.
