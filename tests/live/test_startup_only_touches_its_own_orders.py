"""DL-L5: the loop stops reaching for things that are not its own.

Three findings that share a shape - the loop assumed it was alone on the account and alone on the
filesystem - and one ordering bug.

* **L1-09 / E-31**: ``startup_reconcile`` cancelled *every* open order on the account.  Today that
  is harmless because the loop only sends market orders and there is nothing else on demo; on any
  account with a manual order it silently removes it, and it is also what would delete a protective
  order the moment a restart happened.  Orders are now filtered by the client-id prefixes the loop
  itself issues (``bd-`` for rebalances, ``bdflat-`` for flattens).
* **L1-07**: the kill switch defaulted to a path relative to the working directory, so a CLI run
  from a worktree wrote a file the loop could not see.  Same class as DL-L1: two processes, two
  different working directories, one account.
* **L1-06**: ``live flatten`` closed the book without engaging the kill switch or stopping the
  loop, so the next cycle rebuilt every position it had just closed.  That is the 2026-09-04
  incident path, and the fix is an ordering contract: take the trading rights away first, then
  close.  KILL-R2 named it as the root of the watchdog problem.
