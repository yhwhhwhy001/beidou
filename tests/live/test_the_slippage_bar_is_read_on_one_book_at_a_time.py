"""M-Q08's 4 bps bar was being failed by a 1/3-fraction probe book on behalf of the main book.

On 2026-09-12 the daily report alerted `滑点 5.5 bps 高于假设的 4 bps` and had been doing so for two
days.  Split by the book that carries each symbol, the same 34 fills read:

    main-book-only names   19 fills   +0.80 bps   (mean +2.32, se 1.44)
    both books' names      15 fills  +16.18 bps   (mean +14.23, se 4.43, t = 2.31 vs the bar)

The combined 5.47 is a mixture that describes neither population, and its own error bar is 2.59 -
0.57 SE from the bar it is quoted as breaching.  Same defect as M-Q03's late share (restarts mixed
into scheduled cycles) and M-015's compression (two books summed before the spread was taken): an
aggregate over two populations, presented as a reading of one.

**Operator ruling 2026-09-12: M-Q08 judges the main book.**  Its clause is about the execution fidelity
of the book the demo phase is testing, and the probe sleeve already has its own bar for this - `§3
滑点压力 5.5 档` in `validation/book_limits.py`.  The ruling was made with its cost stated: the main
book holds 19 of the 34 fills, so M-Q08 goes from a FAIL it could not support to a BLIND that says how
many fills short it is.  The combined number stays computed and printed either way - the shape of the
2026-09-10 L3 ruling and of M-015's split on the same day.

A record that cannot name the books is judged on the combined reading, not excused: every trade row
written before 2026-09-12 is that case, and an unreadable split is not a pass.

Since the G9 ruling (2026-09-23) the split is per fill, by the books of its own cycle and the one before
(`test_mq08_judges_each_fill_by_the_books_it_traded_for.py`).  Every fill below sits on one bar, so
`BOOKS_AT` gives that bar the map these tests always meant.
