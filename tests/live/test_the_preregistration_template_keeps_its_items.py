"""The pre-registration template's numbered items are load-bearing, so deleting one must fail.

Each item in `docs/PREREGISTRATION.md` was added because something went wrong without it, and each
one costs the person writing a pre-registration something to fill in.  That is exactly the shape of
a rule that gets quietly dropped: the next author is in a hurry, the item is prose in a Markdown
file, and nothing notices.  Item 5 (the power reading, added 2026-09-18 by Q-SY1) had no guard at
all until this file existed.

**What this guards and what it does not.**  It guards the template against deletion.  It does NOT
make anyone fill the items in - a pre-registration that skips item 8 still runs, because nothing
reads the template at validate time.  The honest description is "a convention with a tripwire", and
saying so here matters: the analysis that added item 8 was itself criticised (K-LD10) for calling a
read location a prevention.  Turning this into a real mechanism means `research validate` refusing
to run without the line, the way it already refuses without `--grid`/`--charge` (PR #40).  That is a
CLI change against a package with no source-budget headroom, and it is deliberately not done here.

The count is asserted separately from the titles so that ADDING an item fails too: a ninth item is
fine, but the heading that announces "必写的八项" has to move with it, or the document starts lying
about itself.
