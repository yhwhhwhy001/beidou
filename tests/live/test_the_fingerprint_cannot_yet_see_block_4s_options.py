"""D-026 gap, recorded rather than assumed away: `vol_model` and `budget_mode` move no digest.

`construction_fingerprint` enumerates its keys by hand, so a `PortfolioParams` field it does not name
changes every weight in the book while the running record keeps saying the construction is unchanged.
That is exactly the silence D-026 was written to end - and the one it was itself caught leaving open
once, when `LiveConfig` did not carry `vol_target` and P13 could have doubled the risk budget without
moving the digest.

Block 4's two options (#35 GARCH divisor, #48 HRP budget) are built off by default in `beidou_alpha`,
so nothing live reads them today and the gap is harmless *while they are off*.  Naming them in the
fingerprint is a `beidou_live` change, which belongs to the Phase 4a batch that turns one of them on
(restart, and M-010's 30-day window back to zero) rather than to building them.

This test therefore asserts the gap is still there, in the shape `test_source_budget` uses for the line
budget: closing it makes this test fail, and the failure says what to delete.
