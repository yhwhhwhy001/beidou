"""A restart that found a bar a failed cycle had already lost took the failure's charge over (🟡, 2026-09-23).

Restart #56, read off the record.  The scheduled cycle for the 2026-09-23T15:00Z bar failed at 16:01:02Z
on the proxy, and the 16:10Z hourly check said what had happened: one bar lost to a failed cycle, look at
the path to the venue, not at a restart - and it paged, because a lost bar is an hour with no stop check
(`daily_alerts`, 2026-09-16).  At 16:41:45Z restart #56's `--immediate` cycle found that same bar
unrebalanced, 2,505s past its close, and wrote the miss row a late restart writes.  From 17:11Z the same
one miss read as the restart's - "最迟的一次在 bar 收盘后 2505 秒；失败动作：查重启原因" - and the page
stopped, with seven hourly checks of the day still to run.

The cause was one set.  `restart_cost` put a skip row's bar in the set that excuses a failed bar, which is
meant for bars that got their rebalance after all.  So the second row did not add a charge; it took the
first one over.  The count was right, one bar and one miss.  The attribution was wrong, and the
attribution is the part that sends someone somewhere.  The record holds this shape twice: 2026-09-08T05:00
failed on the same proxy and a restart found it 17 minutes later.

What stays as it was: the restart is still a restart, counted, with its 2,505s; and a restart that finds a
bar ALREADY rebalanced still excuses a failure on it, because that bar did get its book set.

The two rows are the record's, verbatim, in `tests/fixtures/mq03/`, and are checked against the record
where it exists (the main checkout; CI and worktrees skip that one test).
