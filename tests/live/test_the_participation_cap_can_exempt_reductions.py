"""T-S03's cap truncated reductions too, and its own comment said it did not (2026-09-13 review).

`RebalanceParams.max_participation` is documented as a cap "on a risk-adding order", but the exemption
in `plan_rebalance` was `not closing` - a full close only.  A 15% -> 5% pure reduction was truncated by
`max_participation x trailing volume`, which is the number that shrinks in exactly the bar where
getting smaller matters: the second pass of the review named this as one of three things that make the
exit channel contract with liquidity.

Widening it changes live fills and every backtest number, so it is `exempt_reductions`, default False,
and the default path has to stay bit-identical.  That is what the first test here pins.  The knob's
other half is `beidou_alpha.backtest.ParticipationModel.exempt_reductions`; the two must be flipped
together, and `tests/alpha/test_participation_exempt_reductions_tracks_live.py` is the test that holds
them to the same rule.
