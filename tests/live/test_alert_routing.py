"""What pages the operator vs what only lands in the daily report.

`com.beidou.check` ran red hourly for three days on a TRUE but unactionable line: two construction
changes had landed on 2026-09-04 and a promotion cannot be un-done.  It also double-posted to the
alert channel every hour: two writers on one channel, and a dedup window then equal to the job's own
period, which is a coin flip rather than a suppression.  A standing governance fact is exactly
the repeated alert that `beidou_live/alerts.py` warns makes the one that matters get missed, so it
no longer pages at all: it stays in the report's Evidence window block, where a human reads it at
review time.  Operational alerts - drift, risk budget, risk adaptation - are untouched.

# --- M-Q03's two halves, split 2026-09-16 (operator's decision) -------------------------------------
#
# M-Q03 was wholly a notice, for a reason this module's docstring gives: a planned deployment restart
# costs a rebalance, cannot be undone, and would hold the hourly check red until UTC midnight.  That
# argument covers restart misses.  It does NOT cover the other half the reporter learned to count the
# same day: a bar whose CYCLE FAILED is an hour in which the book was not rebalanced and - because the
# exit overlay rests no order at the venue - not checked for stops either, and the thing to do about it
# is on the path to the venue, now, not at review.  So the failed half pages and the restart half does
# not.  The operator priced the cadence before choosing: one failed bar re-announces hourly until UTC
# midnight, the same way `live status`'s 95% gate already does for the same incident.
