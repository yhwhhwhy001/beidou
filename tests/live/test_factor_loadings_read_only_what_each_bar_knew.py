"""#6.4 / #6.9: the multi-factor loadings read only what each bar knew, and read the book D-045 reads.

Each property is a way the reading could be wrong while still printing plausible numbers:

- **No look-ahead in the sorts.**  Everything after a cutoff bar is shuffled - klines, funding and the
  universe the later cycles recorded - and every sort key up to and including the cutoff is compared
  bit for bit, the ranking with it.  A one-bar leak is visible at the cutoff and nowhere else, so a
  control hands each of the three keys one bar of the future and the comparison has to see it.
  Until 2026-09-25 every name here settled funding every eight hours and the one cutoff sat between
  two settlements, so a funding key that read one settlement ahead passed.  Now two names settle
  every hour and two every four, as LSKUSDT and HYPEUSDT do live, and eight cutoffs cover every phase.
- **The legs are chosen at the pair's first bar.**  Every key can be in time while a reading picks the
  pair (t, t+1)'s legs with t+1's keys; only a comparison of the factor returns sees that.
- **Each sort points the way its label says.**  A sign flip would invert a loading's meaning silently.
- **The regression reads the book D-045 reads.**  With the dummy switched off, the market-only fit is
  `report beta`'s conditional beta on the same state, to the last bit the tolerance allows.
- **Planted loadings come back.**  A book built as a known mix of the factors, net exposure on the
  market and BTC, gross on the sorts, and an alpha only on bars where the signal held a short.  The
  book is built from `factor_returns` itself, so it says nothing about how the factors are formed; the
  two properties above do.  It is also built again on exposure that moves every bar, because one
  `vol_target` step cannot tell the exposure carried into a bar from the one it ended with.
- **Both readers print where the archive stops**, and `report beta --out` still writes D-045's page
  when the factor page fails.

The cycle rows copy their field names and nesting from the live record, not from memory: the row with
`bar_open_ms` 1790269200000 (`at` 2026-09-24T18:00:30+00:00) for a traded cycle, the ERROR shape of
the one with `bar_open_ms` 1788843600000 for a failed one, and the attribution row for the operator's
2026-09-10T04:00Z flatten (`foreign` with `by_symbol`, `reconciled`, `rows`, `total`).
