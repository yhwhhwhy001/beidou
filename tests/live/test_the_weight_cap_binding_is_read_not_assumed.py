"""D-046: `max_weight` binding was listed as a cause and never measured; now it is read.

`risk_adaptation`'s docstring names four honest reasons compression can rise with stage 1 untouched,
and one of them - "``max_weight`` binding on the calmest names" - stopped being hypothetical when
`vol_target` went to 0.60.  Nothing had to be recorded to measure it: `book_weights` has been in the
cycle row since 2026-09-12, and a name the cap truncated sits at exactly `max_weight`.

The reading is a lower bound whenever a bar was ALSO gross-capped, because stage 3 clips per symbol
and then scales the whole row.  The bound has to render as a bound - that is most of this file.
