"""M-015's own docstring pre-registered this fix before the alert that needed it.

`RISK_COMPRESSION_LIMIT`'s comment has said since 2026-09-08:

    Alert again from a cancellation and the answer is to measure the main book separately,
    NOT to raise this a second time.

On 2026-09-10 it alerted, and kept alerting for two days at 0.96-0.97 against 0.76.  Decomposed on
the live book of 2026-09-12:

    fourteen names only tsmom holds   risk contribution 0.024199 EVERY ONE, spread 1.000000
    four names the flow probe overlays  0.0078 / 0.0119 (cancelling) and 0.0563 / 0.0628 (stacking)

The whole 8.07x risk spread is max/min over those four.  Stage 1 is not what moved: on the names it
alone sizes it is exact to six figures.  The probe book is vol-targeted on its own at fraction 1/3
over four names against the main book's eighteen, so it carries ~1.4x the main book's per-name risk
where they overlap - arithmetic, not a fault, and invisible to a max/min taken after `combine_books`.

So the gate follows the single-book reading and the combined one is still computed and printed - the
same shape as the 2026-09-10 L3 ruling: moving a reading out of the gate is not deleting it.
