"""2026-09-09: the number that STOPS A BOOK was in no digest at all.

Measured before the fix - the shipped registry, the same registry with tsmom's stop deleted, and the
same registry with `max_loss` tightened sixty-fold produced three IDENTICAL digests, in all three
places that hash a registry: `registry_digest` (what the loop reports every cycle), the construction
fingerprint, and `registry_fingerprint` (what a research report records).

So a probe's stop could be relaxed, tightened until it fired daily, or removed outright, and
`live status --check` would keep saying "registry：与正在运行的循环一致".  That is KILL-Q15's shape
on a risk control, and worse than on the universe: the universe decides WHAT is traded, this decides
whether a book gets halted at all.
