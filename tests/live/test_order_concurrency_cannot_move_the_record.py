"""Serial order sending inflates the very slippage it is measured by (2026-09-13 perf item P3).

`execute_order` sleeps 1.0s up to `poll_attempts` times whenever an ack is not terminal, and the loop
sends one order at a time, so the LAST order of a bar can leave tens of seconds after the first.  The
further from the decision the fill is, the further the price is from `decision_close` - and
`decision_close` is exactly what M-Q08 measures slippage against, recorded on every trade row
(`engine._record_fill`).  So the sending strategy pushes the number that judges the sending strategy.

`order_concurrency` is the lever, and it is off (1) by default.  Two properties have to hold before it
can ever be turned on, and they are what this module pins:

* at 1 the path is the serial loop it has always been - same sends, same order, same rows;
* above 1 the ARRIVAL order changes and the RECORD does not.  `store.append_trade` and
  `record["orders"]` are the append-only trade log and the cycle row that every later reader
  reconstructs a bar from, and neither may follow whichever venue answered first.

Double-sending is not among the risks: `client_order_id` is derived from the bar and `execute_order`
queries before it submits (D-032 / T-L01).  What concurrency changes is latency and arrival order,
which is why those two are the things under test.

Two rules were added on 2026-09-25 and hold at any concurrency: reductions are sent before anything
that adds risk, and one order raising no longer stops the orders behind it (the last two tests).
