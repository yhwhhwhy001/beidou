"""D-045: an exit the venue did not execute keeps saying flat instead of re-anchoring as a new entry.

`exit_step` drops the anchors when a rule fires, which is right in a backtest - weight 0 IS flat on
the next bar - and is not enough live, where the close can fail to land: `plan_rebalance` refuses one
inside the absolute band (`BAND_BLOCKS_EXIT`), below `minNotional`, or on a venue rejection.  The next
cycle used to see `direction` 0 against a held position and take the "direction changed" branch, which
rebuilds `unit` from the CURRENT bar's sigma.  That is not "k daily sigmas fixed at entry" (D-012), and
it misses in the dangerous direction: sigma rises, the stop widens, and the position that just failed
to close is the one whose stop just got looser.

    Same position, same bar, two volatility regimes.  Re-anchoring takes ``unit`` from the bar it

    sigma reads 0.01 and about 48 when it reads 0.08.  The position is 13 points under water, so the
