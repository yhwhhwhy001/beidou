"""The general form of KILL-Q15, mechanised: change a registry leaf, and ask whether a digest moves.

`registry_digest` exists because the loop builds its model once at startup, so an edit to the file
changes what the registry SAYS without changing what the loop TRADES.  `live status --check` compares
the recorded digest against the file's, which closes that gap only for the leaves the digest actually
covers.  On 2026-09-09 the probe stop turned out not to be one of them: the shipped registry, the same
registry with tsmom's stop deleted, and the same registry with `max_loss` tightened sixty-fold gave
identical digests in all three hashers, so a book's halt threshold could be changed and the check would
keep reporting "与正在运行的循环一致".

Reading the hasher does not find that; mutating the file does.  So this walks every leaf of the shipped
registry, changes it, and asserts a digest moves - except for the leaves named below, each of which has
to say why it is exempt.  A count would pass as the exempt set grew, so the set is named.
