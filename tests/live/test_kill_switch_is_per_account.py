"""L1-07, still open: the emergency stop resolves against the working directory.

DL-L5 fixed the half that lived inside one process - `live_cmd` and `live_config` each built the path
from the raw profile string, so they could disagree without anyone moving.  One helper, resolved once,
and that part is real.  The half the helper's own docstring describes is untouched: `Path(...).resolve()`
anchors a relative path to `os.getcwd()`, so

    beidou live kill-switch          # from the repo    -> /Users/.../beidou/.beidou/live/KILL_SWITCH
    beidou live kill-switch          # from a worktree  -> /Users/.../worktrees/x/.beidou/live/KILL_SWITCH

are different files, and the loop reads the first.  Measured 2026-09-07 against the running loop: the
second prints "kill switch engaged", exits 0, and stops nothing.

This is DL-L1's sentence again.  What has to be unique per ACCOUNT cannot be addressed by a path
relative to a working directory - which is why the instance lock is keyed to the API key and lives in
Application Support, and why the kill switch belongs beside it.

The engine reads the union of both, because a kill switch must fail toward stopping: an operator who
engages the old path still stops the book, and release has to clear both or they would be stuck.
