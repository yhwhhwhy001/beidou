"""DL-L1: one trading process per account, enforced rather than assumed.

C-P1, and the most concrete risk on the book today.  There are seven git worktrees on this machine;
``run_live.sh`` sources the credentials from ``~/.zshrc`` globally; ``state_dir`` and the kill switch
are relative paths; ``live run`` defaults to non-dry-run with no arming step.  So `beidou live run
--allow-unvalidated` in any worktree is a second process trading the same account, with its own
state directory, its own kill switch that the other cannot see, and a universe that falls back to
``always_include`` - its non-overlapping positions look foreign to the main loop, and when it exits
they are orphaned.  KILL-R20 also killed the concurrency argument that made this a P2: the two
processes are woken by the same scheduler at close+5s, so a collision is not a random arrival.

Three decisions that the tests below pin down:

* the lock key is the **API key fingerprint**, not the state directory - the thing that must be
  exclusive is the account, and every worktree has a different directory;
* the lock path is absolute (``~/Library/Application Support/beidou``), for the same reason L1-07
  moves the kill switch off a relative path: two processes with different working directories were
  locking different files;
* a rejected instance exits **0** with an alert.  Non-zero would have launchd relaunch it every
  ThrottleInterval and alert every time (KILL-R20(d)); 0 leaves the winner alone and says so once.
