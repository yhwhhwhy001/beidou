"""R8's first rung could not place an order, and neither half of the record said so (2026-09-14).

`Policy.drawdown_ladder`'s first rung takes `vol_target` 0.30 -> 0.225, which is a scalar of 0.75 on
every weight the cycle produces.  A position standing at its unthrottled target therefore needs an
order worth 0.25 x |current notional|, and `no_trade_rel_band` is 0.40 x |current notional|
(config/live.demo.yaml).  `plan_rebalance`'s relative band does not distinguish a resize that ADDS risk
from one that SHEDS it, so the de-escalation was swallowed whole: 0.25 < 0.40, every cycle, for as long
as the attributed drawdown stayed between the two rungs.  Only the second rung (0.15 / 0.30 = 0.50, a
half-sized book) cleared the band, so the two-rung ladder had one rung that could reach the venue.

0.30 is what the loop ran from R8's wiring (1112fe97, 2026-09-09) until the 0.60 restart on
2026-09-13T18:00Z - 96d659ae wrote 0.60 into the profile, 72034790 moved the cited evidence so the
startup gate would accept it, and the newest cycle carries construction 46b8d731530a.  At 0.60 the
rungs are 0.375 and 0.25 and both clear the band, so nothing is broken at the k running TODAY.  That is
a property of that k and not of the rule: 96d659ae rejected restating the rungs proportionally to the
wider budget (O-3) precisely because it put the first rung back at 0.75.  The tests below therefore pin
the RULE at a given scalar rather than any profile's k.

2026-09-14, after this fix landed: O-3 WAS adopted - the rungs are now ((-0.49, 0.45), (-0.70, 0.30))
against the -70% budget, so the first rung is back at 0.75 exactly as 96d659ae feared.  It is safe
because of the fix this file is about, which is the order the two changes had to happen in: the
exemption first, the rescale second.  Had they landed the other way round the ladder would have gone
back to having one reachable rung, and nothing in the record would have said so.

Both halves of the record read normal on their own.  `risk_ladder.acting` was true - the ladder DID
de-escalate, it produced a smaller target - and `skipped[]` carried an ordinary `NO_TRADE_BAND`, the
same row a quiet symbol writes on a quiet bar.  The two only contradict each other when read together,
which is the same shape as the defect the ladder itself closed: a thing that looks like a control and
controls nothing.

The fix leaves the band's ordinary semantics untouched and makes the exception the ladder's own state:
`plan_rebalance(..., deescalating=True)` drops the RELATIVE band for same-direction reductions only.
The absolute band stays, so the exemption cannot manufacture dust.  This is the narrow half of the
choice.  The wide half - a `RebalanceParams` knob shaped like `exempt_reductions` - would move every
ordinary cycle and every backtest number, because `no_trade_rel_band`'s other half is
`beidou_alpha.portfolio.apply_no_trade_band` and the two are one recursion (D-033).  The ladder has no
backtest half at all: `beidou_alpha` contains no `drawdown_ladder` and no `throttle_scalar`.
