"""KILL-027's monitor fired six times in 48 hours and left no recoverable evidence any of them.

`run_check.sh` pages with `"$(echo "$output" | tail -n 3 | tr '\\n' ' ')"`, and this command's output is
pretty-printed JSON sorted by key.  Its last three lines are `"tolerance": 1e-09`, `}` and the error,
so every one of the six alerts between 2026-09-10T18:10Z and 2026-09-12T09:10Z read:

    FAIL verify:   "tolerance": 1e-09 } Error: 模型已无法复现上一周期的 contributions（...）

By the time anyone looked, `state.json` had been overwritten by the next cycle and the diff was gone.
The cause was only found by replaying 56 cycles offline against freshly fetched klines, which
reproduced all six exactly - every one a single symbol in the `flow` book, 3.3e-8 to 8.5e-7 against a
1e-9 tolerance, on the four names whose `taker_buy_quote / quote_volume` the flow signal reads.

Two things follow.  The first: the payload must name the offenders, in the note itself, so the one
line that survives the pager says which strategy and which symbol moved.

The second is the cause, measured 2026-09-12 by two experiments that bracket it:

* re-fetching the bar that closed at 12:00Z at +15s, +60s, +300s and +600s over six symbols returned
  byte-identical values on every field - the kline is settled by +15s;
* of the 57 replayed cycles, **all six failures fetched within 14s of the close, and 0 of the 22 that
  fetched later than 14s failed**.

So the loop can read a bar the venue has not finished aggregating, and `flow` is the only book that
reads the two fields finalised last.  `SETTLE_SECONDS` says so in the alert.  It gates nothing and
widens no tolerance: a cycle inside the window still fails to reproduce, it just also says why.
