"""AC-L4's other half: the numbers land in `cycles.jsonl` and the daily report never mentions them.

DL-L4 gave every restart two facts - how late it woke relative to the bar close, and whether that cost
a rebalance - and wrote them into the cycle row.  The acceptance criterion asks for them in the DAILY
REPORT, because that is where an operator sees them; in the JSONL they are read by nobody.

RISK-P2 is why they exist at all: every deployment restart is assumed to cost late fills and 7bps of
gross, and the plan asked for that assumption to be COUNTED rather than carried.  L1-01's error was the
same shape in reverse - measuring the fills that happened rather than the ones that should not have.

2026-09-09 audit, and what changed here.  The numbers reached the markdown and stopped: nothing compared
them to anything, and `daily_alerts` did not read `restarts` at all.  M-Q03's thresholds were not missing
either - the 2026-09-06 remediation plan's own row carries "<= 5% / 0" and "查重启原因" - they simply had
no reader, so they are now in `config/live.demo.yaml` beside M-Q08's and this module judges against them.

Wiring the judgement first required fixing what it would have judged.  `missed_rebalances` was
reconstructed from the engine's per-process RUNNING TOTAL, which cannot see three consecutive processes
that each missed exactly one: on the real record for 2026-09-09 it read 1 where three separate restarts
had each written a miss row.  Every miss appends exactly one cycle row, so the rows ARE the count, and
the reconstruction was a strictly worse estimator of the same thing (it also charged a process that
spanned midnight with yesterday's misses).
