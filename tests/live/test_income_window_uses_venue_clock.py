"""D-030: the income window is on the venue's clock, because a signed request's immunity does not cover it.

A wrong host clock is invisible on the auth path - a -1021 makes the REST client resync and retry, so a
signed request's ``timestamp`` is always venue-correct.  ``startTime``/``endTime`` on /fapi/v1/income are
plain query parameters and were passed through untouched, so with the host an hour behind the venue
(measured 2026-09-04) the loop asked for an hour-old window.  Proven the same day: after a manual flatten,
96 rows worth +23.98 USDT sat at venue times 07:51-07:53 while the loop queried [06:53, 06:58] and ingested
nothing.  Income was not lost - it arrived an hour late, attributed to the book held an hour after it was
earned, which is the corruption M-010 exists to rule out.
