"""Bit-for-bit equivalence between `ladder_step` and the engine method it was lifted out of.

D-033's technique, for the same reason it was used there: an extraction that changes what the live
loop does is a behaviour change wearing a refactor's name, and the only honest way to say it did not
is to run both against the same inputs and compare every output.

There are three outputs, and all three are compared: the block written into `cycles.jsonl`, the rung
persisted into `state.risk_ladder`, and the operator messages - because the messages are the only part
an operator ever sees, and a silently reworded alert is a real regression in a system where paging is
deduplicated on the text.

The comparison itself was a throwaway: the old body was kept as `_dead_risk_ladder`, both were run
over 128 combinations of standing rung x base x drawdown, and they were identical on all three outputs.
Then the old body was deleted, in the same commit.  What is left here is the successor - the behaviour
those 128 combinations covered, pinned against the pure function so it cannot drift back.
