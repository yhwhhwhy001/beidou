"""M-002 / M-010 / M-G06 annualise a series at 8760 bars a year that had four fifths of its hours cut out.

An attribution row is written only by a cycle that HAD income.  Both readers then take the resulting
list as if it were one point per hour: `sharpe(values, bars_per_year=8760)` and `days = size / 24`.
Measured on the live record 2026-09-12, over the 214 cycles the attribution file spans:

    tsmom   41 rows (19% of cycles)   days read 1.71 vs 8.92   Sharpe -15.84 vs -6.78 on the grid
    flow    25 rows (12% of cycles)   days read 1.04 vs 8.92   Sharpe  -2.38 vs -0.77 on the grid

The inflation is sqrt(cycles/rows) - 2.28 and 2.93 predicted, 2.33 and 3.08 measured - because
dropping zeros leaves the sum alone while shrinking the count, so the mean grows faster than the sd.
Those gaps are true zeros: these rows carry realised P&L, commission and funding only, and a cycle
with none of them earned none of them.

It never changed a verdict.  M-G06's criterion is "point estimate >= 0 and nothing else", and deleting
zeros cannot move a sign.  M-010 is the one that was not safe: it divides by a FIXED expected Sharpe's
distance, so an inflated realised number and an inflated error bar do not cancel there.  And
`_has_dispersion`'s 48-bar floor - written as "enough bars", meaning hourly ones - was being asked of
a series where 48 rows meant ten days.
