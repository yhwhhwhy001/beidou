"""The edge-decay rule the operator adopted on 2026-09-07 (report section 4.2 Ⅰ, ruling in 12.9).

The report asked what statistic would detect decay in the live period and proposed one; it went
unanswered until now.  The adopted rule: **M-010's 30-day rolling Sharpe against the backtest's
distribution of same-length windows, two consecutive windows below q10 -> review.**

Three things are pinned here rather than left to the reader, because each of them is a way the rule
would quietly get looser after the fact:

* **Windows do not overlap.**  "Two consecutive 30-day windows" with a daily step is two observations
  sharing 29 days of data - very nearly one observation, and it fires far more often than the design
  intends.  Non-overlapping means the trigger costs 60 days of evidence.
* **The comparison is to an empirical distribution, not to a point estimate.**  A strategy with a 1.7
  annualised Sharpe has enormous dispersion over 30 days; its q10 is likely well below zero.  Comparing
  the live number to `oos_sharpe` with a normal standard error is a different and much weaker test -
  `drift_vs_expectation` already does that one, and the two coexist rather than replace each other.
* **A missing q10 is INSUFFICIENT_DATA, never OK.**  The quantile has to come from the same construction
  and is not computed yet.  Reporting OK because there is nothing to compare against is how a detector
  that has never worked looks healthiest - the `metrics_parity` `rate: None` lesson.

It cannot fire before roughly 2026-11-05: the construction froze on 2026-09-06 and the rule needs two
whole non-overlapping windows after that.  Writing it now, before any window exists, is the point -
a decay rule authored after seeing the decay is not a rule.
