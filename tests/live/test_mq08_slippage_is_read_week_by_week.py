"""M-Q08 on one page: slippage as a trend beside its judged number, and all four clauses together.

The judged slippage reading pools thirty days, so it cannot say whether fills are getting better or
worse.  The trend buckets the same fills by week with the same arithmetic - pinned below to the bit - and
differs in exactly one thing: it splits each fill by the books of its OWN cycle.  The judged reading
splits every fill by the newest cycle's map, so once the probe book is flat every fill reads main-only;
on 2026-09-23 that was 119 fills judged as the main book's where their own cycles name 72.
