"""A corrupt `state.json` must stop `live run` and must not stop the way out of a position.

`StateStore.load` refuses a state file it cannot parse rather than returning a fresh `LiveState`
(2026-09-13).  That refusal is right for the loop: the file is the only copy of the income watermark,
the equity high-water mark, the exit anchors and the D-005 hold seeds, and silently zeroing it puts a
hole in M-010 that nothing can detect afterwards.

It is wrong for the two readers.  `beidou live flatten` needs the venue's positions and nothing else,
and the file is most likely to be half-written exactly when the process died mid-cycle - which is when
someone reaches for flatten.  `beidou report daily` is the unattended monitor: it is how a broken file
gets noticed at all, so it has to render and say so rather than die on the first line.
