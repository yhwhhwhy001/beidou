"""§5 L3, ruled on 2026-09-10: the no-decision reading is the gate, and the streak gets the bar.

§5 states L3 twice and the two disagree.  "7 天无 ERROR 相" counts ERROR cycles; the Testnet paragraph
of the same section says an ERROR phase "不产生任何治理决定", which KILL-AR-20 turned into
`Policy.no_decision_phases`.  On the armed record the second holds and the first cannot: 0.318 ERROR
per day gives a 10.8% chance of seven consecutive clean days, 1.2% of fourteen, 0.03% of thirty - and
the cause is the system proxy §5 names itself two paragraphs later.

**Why the no-decision reading rather than the achievable one.**  Choosing the criterion a deployment
happens to pass is the move the mine pre-registrations forbid, so the reason cannot be "the other one
fails".  It is this: only one of the two sentences has a mechanism behind it.  `no_decision_phases`
exists, is enforced, and is falsifiable per cycle - an ERROR cycle that placed an order, quarantined a
sleeve or moved the ladder would fail it and be visible in the row.  The literal count has no
mechanism; it is a tally of a phase whose definition is "we declined to act on bad data", which is the
loop working, not failing.  The contradiction predates every measurement in this file.

**And the criterion is made HARDER in the dimension that matters.**  The no-decision reading alone
cannot see a venue outage: six hours of 503s decide nothing either, and a week containing one is not
a week that proved unattended operation.  So the longest ERROR STREAK gets a bar - and the bar is not
invented.  `live status --check` already fails when the heartbeat is ERROR with `consecutive_errors
>= 3`, which is the alarm that pages the operator.  A week that contained an incident the hourly check
was paging about must not pass L3, so L3 reuses that number rather than picking one.  KILL-R6 refuted
invented seconds bars; this is the same refusal applied to a count.

The literal reading stays computed and printed.  Ruling it out of the gate is not the same as hiding
it, and the day the proxy is replaced it becomes reachable again.
