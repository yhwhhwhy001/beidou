"""L1-10: how much of "equity" is BTC rather than the book (report-only, deliberately).

The demo account is on multi-assets margin, so `totalMarginBalance` - the number the drawdown ladder and
the vol sizing divide by - includes non-USDT collateral valued at mark.  BTC moves and the book's measured
equity moves with it, even on a bar where the book did nothing.  A -35% reading on that series can be the
ladder reacting to BTC, not to the strategy.

**This does not change the sizing, on purpose.**  Changing what the guardrails divide by would change
every position size, which is a construction change: it would reset M-010's evidence window and needs to
be decided on its own merits by the operator, not smuggled in as a bug fix.  What was actually missing is
that nobody could SEE the divergence.  So this measures it and the daily report prints it, and the number
the book trades on is untouched.

`/fapi/v2/account` already carries the per-asset breakdown in `assets`; it was being thrown away.
