"""M-007 and D-025: the daily report must not read 0.00% while the book is carrying margin.

Three separate blind spots the 2026-09-04 system check found, one test file:

* M-007's "peak margin usage" measured what a cycle's *new orders* asked for, not what the *held* book
  consumes, so it printed 0.00% on a day whose only margin-consuming order predated the evidence window
  while fifteen positions held 577 USDT of initial margin;
* the host clock was a full hour behind the venue and nothing in the report said so, although every
  timestamp in it - including the day it is named after - is the host's;
* CYSUSDT was traded live for sixteen hours with no 1h klines in the research store, so every backtest
  silently ran without it and only a log line nobody reads mentioned it.
