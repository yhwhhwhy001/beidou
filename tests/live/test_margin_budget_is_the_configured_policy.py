"""M-007's bar was the plan's 50%, while the policy that governs the same quantity is `margin_cap` 0.40.

Two numbers for one quantity, and the looser one was doing the judging - the `max_slippage_bps` shape the
profile already records ("A fee-inclusive budget judging a fee-exclusive number, at 2.5x the stated bar,
could not fail").  Realized standing margin could sit anywhere in 40-50%, above the configured policy,
and M-007 would read OK.

The second half is that it could not have been read anyway: `over_budget` was computed, rendered into the
daily markdown, and never routed - `daily_alerts` had no margin branch at all, so the finding reached
neither the alert list nor the notice list.  D-038's shape once more.

The plan's 50% is kept beside the bar rather than deleted, because what it was wrong ABOUT is the record.
