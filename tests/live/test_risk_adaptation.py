"""M-015: the report can tell "sizing adapts per symbol" from "every symbol is treated alike".

The operator asked three times why every order carries the same 5x, because nothing in the report
answered it.  D-037 already established that the exchange leverage is inert here and that adaptation
lives in the weight; these tests are the instrument that says so from the live record, and - the part
that matters - that would stop saying so if stage 1 were ever removed.
