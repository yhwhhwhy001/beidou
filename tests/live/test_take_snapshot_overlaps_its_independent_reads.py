"""`take_snapshot` awaited three REST calls in a row, two of which do not need each other.

`account` and `positions` are independent; `mark_prices` needs the symbol set `positions` returns and
has to stay behind them.  On this deployment the path to the venue goes through a system proxy that
intermittently 503s, so a saved round trip per cycle is worth having, and the loop runs hourly with a
startup window - it is not free latency, it is one fewer chance to hit the proxy.

Nothing about the snapshot's contents may change, which is the first test here.  The second pins the
part `asyncio.gather` does NOT preserve for free: the sequential version always surfaced `account()`'s
failure, because `positions()` never ran.  `gather` raises whichever child fails first in time, and it
starts its children in argument order, so `account` still wins when both fail before awaiting I/O.
