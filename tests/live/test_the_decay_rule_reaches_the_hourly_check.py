"""G1 (2026-09-23): §12.9's decay rule reaches the hourly check, and its windows start at the construction.

The rule was adopted 2026-09-07 and built the same day, and its only reader was `report weekly` - which no
job runs.  So a REVIEW would have been computed by nobody.  `report daily --check` is what the hourly job
runs, and these tests pin what it now does with the rule:

* **REVIEW pages; nothing else does.**  Two whole windows below q10 is an alert.  One window below is OK.
  INSUFFICIENT_DATA - the reading for sixty days after every construction change - is rendered in the
  report and routed nowhere, not even as a notice.
* **The windows start where M-010's does.**  §12.9: "构造一变，q10 必须重算，与 M-010 的清零语义一致".
  Until this change the windows were read from bar zero, so on the live record the first one would
  have mixed six canonical constructions.  An aliased digest must NOT restart them.
* **The daily and the weekly read the rule identically**, because they make the same call.
* **The page names both calibers.**  The live windows are realised attributed income and q10 is the
  backtest's mark-to-market; operator ruling A (2026-09-23) keeps the comparison and labels it.

The q10s are not invented here: they come from the evidence reports the registry cites today, through
`expectations_from_evidence` - the path `report daily` itself takes.  Only the live record is synthetic,
and it is built so each 30-day window's Sharpe is known in closed form.
