"""2026-09-09: §3 says the main book keeps its P&L stop, and nothing computed one.

`probes_from_registry` excluded `MAIN_BOOK` unconditionally, with no comment and no test.  So the
book that carries the whole `fraction` had its 30-day trailing attributed P&L not merely un-acted-on
but never CALCULATED - and what a rule cannot see it cannot bound.

The semantics are §3's, not the engine's existing stop.  §3 gives the two transitions different
channels on purpose: `probe -> retired` is "快：`stopped_books`" and `main -> probe` is not.  Halting
a probe IS the control; halting a `fraction` 1.0 book is switching the strategy off, and §3 says a
main sleeve that fires is demoted and recounts.  So main's stop reports and moves the lifecycle; it
does not empty the book.
