"""D-031 under a pinned universe: the one path that could shrink the traded set behind the digest.

Found on 2026-09-09 by the sweep in `test_the_digest_sees_every_live_knob.py` - not by that test, but
by the question it asks, pointed at the profile instead of the registry.  `pool.quarantine_after` is a
live knob outside `construction_fingerprint`, which led to reading what it does: `_quarantine` removed
a symbol from `self.universe` and left `self.model` alone, so `registry_digest` - which reads the
model's pinned universe - stayed byte-identical while the loop traded 17 of 18 symbols.  Measured, not
reasoned: the same digest `abe21f7a8edf` before and after.

The pin, shipped the same day, is what made this matter.  Before it the digest carried no universe at
all; after it the digest's claim is "this is the population this process manages", and D-031 was the
one path that could falsify that claim silently.  Under a pin it also does not heal: the daily re-rank
records a proposal and adopts nothing, so a quarantined symbol stays gone until a restart.
