"""DL-X1: the loop can finally see how close it is to a liquidation - and when it cannot.

Report §4.2 Ⅴ listed "no liquidation observability at runtime" and L1-05 found ``INSURANCE_CLEAR``
and its neighbours being dropped on the floor by ``attribute``.  The A-P2 probe (2026-09-06, demo,
read-only) settled how to read the field, and the answer is the reason this file exists:

    liq == 0 for **14 of 14 longs**, non-zero for **4 of 4 shorts**

Under cross margin with a large equity, a long's liquidation price computes at or below zero and
Binance reports ``0``.  So ``0`` means *unreachable at this equity*, not *at liquidation* - and a
distance metric that reads it as a price would alarm on every long, forever.  That is the same shape
as E-37, where the 18-unit disaster stop was un-placeable on 7 of 18 symbols for the same reason.

The margin-mode assertion is KILL-R19's: the loop refuses to start against an account whose
``marginType``/``multiAssetsMargin`` differ from the ones its validation assumed, rather than
quietly trading a different risk model.  It asserts; it never sets.
