"""Falsifier F1 of the 2026-09-12 pre-registration: an observability field that moves a traded weight.

The probe stop is calibrated against a mark-to-market P&L and reads a realised-income series instead -
30-day sigma 0.137% of equity against the 2.34% its own evidence is in, so the -2% stop sits at 14.6
sigma and cannot fire.  Fixing the caliber needs each BOOK's own weights, and nothing in the record
carries them: `contributions` is per strategy and pre-sizing, `targets` is already the sum.

`AlphaModel.targets` therefore recomputes `book_weights` beside the weights it returns.  The
pre-registration made this the hardest falsifier of the change, because it is the one that would make
the change something other than what it claims to be:

    F1: if recording `book_weights` changes ANY symbol's final target weight, stop.

`combine_books` of the recorded book weights must BE the returned weights - not approximately, and
not "close enough": they come from the same pure function `weights_from` already calls.
