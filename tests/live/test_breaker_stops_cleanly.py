"""DL-L2: the breaker stops the loop instead of feeding it back to launchd every 60 seconds.

``KeepAlive.SuccessfulExit=false`` in deploy/com.beidou.live.plist means exit code 0 is not
relaunched, and run_live.sh:24 already says so.  So the whole of L1-03 - a persistent TRIPPED flag,
a process-level backoff counter, and tests for both - collapses into: alert, then exit 0.  Net state
change is negative: ``consecutive_errors`` stops being persisted, because carrying it across
restarts was the thing that made a tripped breaker trip again immediately (KILL-R29).

The sequencing constraint (KILL-P1) is the point of this file.  A loop that exits quietly is worse
than one that hot-loops, because the hot loop at least leaves a trace.  So the clean exit is earned:
the breaker must first get its alert out, and if no channel accepts it the old behaviour stands -
raise, non-zero exit, launchd relaunches, and the operator eventually sees a log full of restarts.
