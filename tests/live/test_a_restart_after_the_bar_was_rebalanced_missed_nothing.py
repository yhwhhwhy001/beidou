"""M-Q03 counted an operator restart as a missed rebalance on a bar that had already been rebalanced.

Measured on the live record, 2026-09-10.  The 05:00 bar closed and the loop rebalanced it at 06:00:27Z
with 18 orders - inside the 106s window, nothing late about it.  The operator then restarted the loop at
06:01:28Z; the new process woke at 06:02:05Z, 125.1s after the close, outside its own 71.6s window, and
`_record_missed_rebalance` wrote a miss row.  M-Q03 went from 1 to 2 and stayed ALERT.

Nothing was missed.  That bar's rebalance had happened ninety seconds earlier, in the outgoing process,
and is in the record with its eighteen fills.  What the incoming process skipped was a SECOND rebalance
of a bar already traded, which is the behaviour anyone would want.

Why it is worth a fix rather than a footnote: M-Q03's failure action is `查重启原因`, and an alarm that
fires on every correctly-executed restart cannot distinguish the two restarts this same day.  At 04:52
the loop woke 3135s after a close whose rebalance never happened - a real miss, from a proxy 503 killing
`exchangeInfo` at startup.  At 06:02 it woke 125s after a close that had been rebalanced.  Counting both
as `missed_rebalances` teaches the operator that the number means "somebody restarted something", and
the loud half of KILL-R6's lesson is that a metric which always fires is the same defect as one that
never does.

**What is deliberately NOT changed here.**  The row still carries `late_seconds`, so it still counts in
`late_cycle_share`.  Whether a startup reconciliation should be in that denominator at all is a question
about M-Q03's caliber, and re-calibrating a metric because today's reading was inconvenient is the move
the mine pre-registrations forbid.  This fix changes one thing only: a bar that was already rebalanced
cannot have had its rebalance missed.  That is a fact about the word, not a threshold.
