"""DL-L4: a restart always reconciles; it only rebalances if it is still on time.

``deploy/run_live.sh`` passes ``--immediate`` unconditionally, so every restart re-runs the last
closed bar - which is how 90 of 119 fills landed a median 21.6 minutes after the close (E-18).  The
09-05 prescription was "only go immediate if ``now - last_close < 120s``", and KILL-R6 took it apart:
a 143-second catch-up would become a 57-minute stale book, a flatten-then-restart an hour of no
positions, and a crash up to 59 minutes with nobody reconciling the account.

So the two halves are separated, which is what the fix should always have been.

* **Reconciliation always runs.**  It is read-only, it is what discovers foreign positions and
  orphaned orders, and there is no window in which skipping it is safer.
* **Rebalancing is what the window gates**, and the window is *derived* rather than picked: the
  grace period the scheduler already waits, plus launchd's ThrottleInterval, plus how long this
  process actually took to start.  Outside it the bar is skipped and counted - the count is the
  point, because L1-01's error was measuring the fills that happened rather than the ones that
  should not have.

    `SETTLE_SECONDS` was measured on 2026-09-12: the venue is still finalising `taker_buy_quote` and
    `quote_volume` for about fifteen seconds after a bar closes, and `flow` is the only book that reads
    them.  `grace_seconds` was 5.0 the whole time, so the loop fetched EVERY bar inside that window -
    not 56% of them, which is what measuring the cycle's row-WRITE time says; the fetch is the first
    thing the cycle does after waking at close + grace.

    The book was never wrong in a way it could act on (the worst target difference those unsettled
    reads produced was 441x below the no-trade band).  What it cost was M-011, which went red on a
    known-benign cause often enough to hide a real one.

    Asserted as an inequality against the measurement rather than as `== 20.0`, so that re-measuring
    the settle window moves this with it instead of leaving a stale constant behind.
