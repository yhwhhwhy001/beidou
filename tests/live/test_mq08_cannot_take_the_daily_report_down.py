"""M-Q08's block runs inside the hourly `report daily --check`, and it judges nothing.

So nothing it raises may reach the rest of the report.  An exception that escapes it fails the whole
command: the hourly check reports "report" as failed, and every alert the report would have carried -
equity drift, the risk budget, a failed bar - goes down with it.  Each case below makes one part of the
block raise a type the first version's narrow catches did not list, and requires the report to come out
whole: the same sections, the same alerts and notices, and the reason printed in the block.
