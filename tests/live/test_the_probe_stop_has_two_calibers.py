"""The probe stop reads a quantity 17x quieter than the one it was calibrated against.

Operator ruling 2026-09-12 (option C of the EXP-G6′ close-out).  Measured, both of them:

    realised attributed income (what it reads)   30-day sigma 0.137% of equity -> -2% is 14.6 sigma
    mark-to-market (what its evidence is in)     30-day sigma 3.239%           -> -2% is  0.62 sigma

Neither is the "-2 sigma" D-019 claimed, and they miss in opposite directions.  Realised income only
moves when a position closes, and the no-trade band held 197 symbol-cycles on the day this was
measured - a sleeve can bleed on the mark for a month while that series barely moves.

The GATE is deliberately not moved here, and the reason is the plan's own rule: `max_loss` is inside
`construction_fingerprint` (`stop_of`), so changing it clears M-010's 30-day window (7.96/30 today) and
restarts M-G06's eighteen months.  §1 puts "changing the construction outside a window" out of scope.
The replacement is measured and waiting for 2026-10-03: the empirical 2.28% quantile of each book's own
30-day mark-to-market P&L, **-7.5%** for flow_short and **-11.2%** for main.
