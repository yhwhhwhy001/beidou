"""M-Q03's late half, ruled 2026-09-10: the share is over SCHEDULED wake-ups, computed from the record.

Two things were wrong with it, found while restarting the system on 2026-09-10.

**One: it could only ever see restarts.**  The engine writes `late_seconds` into a cycle row in exactly
one place - `_record_missed_rebalance`, which runs only on an `--immediate` startup outside the window.
So every member of the numerator was a restart, and a metric named "迟到周期占比" was reporting how
often somebody restarted the loop.  Its denominator was every cycle, so the number moved when the loop
ran MORE, and it could not see the thing it is named for: the audit counted 33 cycles in the record
that landed more than 60s after their bar close, and not one of them was in this share.

**Two: a restart that cost nothing was in it.**  That was the operator's question, and the answer is
no.  A startup reconciliation is not a wake-up; it happens when a person or launchd starts a process.
Counting it measures restart frequency, and `restarts` reports that separately and honestly.

The fix needed no new field.  Every cycle row already carries `at` and `bar_open_ms` - 202 of 202 on
the live record - so the lateness of every cycle was recorded from the beginning and only the reader
was missing.  That is this repository's most-repeated defect, in its most literal form.

**The bar is not invented.**  A cycle counts as late when it woke outside the rebalance window the
ENGINE allowed, read off the rows (`window_seconds`) rather than recomputed here - the same refusal
`widest_window_seconds` already makes.  When the record holds no window at all, the share is `None`
rather than a number: a day with nothing to measure against is not a day nothing was late on.
