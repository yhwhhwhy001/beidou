"""M-010's evidence can lose a block of hours and every reader of it will see a shorter window instead.

`state.py` returns an empty state when `state.json` fails to parse; `engine.py`'s income watermark is
then `self.state.last_income_ms or now`, i.e. *now*, and the income earned while the loop was away is
never queried.  `attribution.jsonl` keeps its rows on both sides of the hole, `decay_watch` reads
`live_windows` as merely shorter, and nothing anywhere says "a stretch is missing".  Every row has
carried `since_ms` / `until_ms` since the first live commit and nothing compared one row's end to the
next row's start.

These tests pin the two halves that must not be confused:

  * a gap is NORMAL - a row is written only by a cycle that had income, so a quiet hour leaves one.
    On the live record 2026-09-13: 42 rows, span 213.0 h, union 37.3 h (`coverage` 0.175), 31 gaps,
    widest 18.0 h, and not one of them lost a cent.  A `coverage` near 1.0 is not the healthy reading
    and this file must never be read as if it were.
  * a gap the loop did NOT run through is the failure, because the cycle at a gap's right edge is the
    one that queried across it.  One cycle period wide, the two shapes are indistinguishable (a single
    quiet hour leaves nothing strictly inside its gap); several periods wide, only the hole does.

And the rule that comes with a new reading: it reports, it does not gate.  `report daily --check`
exits non-zero on `alerts`, so a file full of benign gaps must not add one.
