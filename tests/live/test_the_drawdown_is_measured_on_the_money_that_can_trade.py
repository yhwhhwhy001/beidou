"""The drawdown denominator (2026-09-20), which is M-007's correction one instrument over.

The page carried three drawdowns and none of them answered "我的回撤是多少".  `drawdown_state` reads
total equity and reports the DEEPEST reading ever; `drawdown_vs_hwm_pct` reads total equity and reports
today's; `ladder_drawdown_pct` reads the book's attributed P&L against the ladder's own anchor.  The
fourth line, `giveback_since_hwm_in_usdt_pct`, looks like the answer and is not: it divides a
total-equity giveback by a USDT base, so its numerator and its denominator come from two series whose
high-water marks were 13 hours apart on the day this was written.

That mixing was a decision, not an oversight - A-GB01 (2026-09-15) chose it explicitly, because a
high-water mark on the USDT series "would be a FOURTH ruler on a page whose problem is that it already
carries three".  The operator overturned it on 2026-09-20: collateral cannot open a position, so the
drawdown that matters is the tradable money's, numerator and denominator both.

What the mixing cost, on the live record: 6.58% printed where the tradable series was down 6.00%, and
on 2026-09-16 the page read 5.92% while that series had drawn down 11.40%.
