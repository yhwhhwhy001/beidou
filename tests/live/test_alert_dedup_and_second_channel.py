"""DL-L3: an alert channel that repeats itself is a channel nobody reads.

KILL-R7 measured the failure mode in the repo's own logs: 40 FAIL lines in check.stdout.log, 36 of
them the same sentence, for 36 hours, unhandled.  An unattended loop's only output is its alerts, so
a duplicate storm is not cosmetic - it is how the one alert that matters gets missed.

Two changes, and the order between them is load-bearing.  DL-L2 turns the breaker into a clean exit
(``sys.exit(0)``, which launchd will not relaunch), and a book that stops silently is worse than one
that hot-loops every 60 seconds.  So the breaker's alert has to be deliverable *before* the breaker
is allowed to stop the loop: ``force`` bypasses dedup and the return value says whether any channel
took it.  That is what makes KILL-P1 a sequencing constraint rather than a hope.
