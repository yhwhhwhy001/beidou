"""The cycle record's writers and its declaration, compared - which nothing could do before.

Three defects found in this package on 2026-09-14/15 were the same shape: one writer and one reader
disagreeing about a key of `cycles.jsonl`, with nowhere for the disagreement to surface.  The startup
filter that never reached `state.universe`; the ERROR row that carried none of L3's five decision keys;
`_decided` testing `risk_ladder` for emptiness when `_risk_ladder` never returns `{}`.

Forty-two keys, three writing methods, six reading modules, 192 distinct `.get()` names, and no
declaration anywhere.  `cycle_record.KEYS` is the declaration; this file is the join.

It runs the engine rather than asserting over a hand-built dict, because a hand-built row is exactly
what let `test_l3s_criterion_is_ruled` pass while the composition was wrong.
