"""DL-G9: "the evidence was produced under the construction the loop holds" becomes a string comparison.

The Phase 0 replay suspended KILL-AR-07 for all 48 archived reports, and the reason was not strictness:
`cycles.jsonl` records a construction digest, a digest does not invert, and the startup heartbeat that
does hold the payload is overwritten by the next start.  `construction_problems` could answer the
question, but only at startup with the live config in hand - so a governance replay reading last
month's report had nothing to compare.

The fix is one digest over the intersection of what both sides can describe.  Deliberately not
`construction_fingerprint`: that covers throttle, leverage and `strategy_weights`, which a backtest has
no opinion about, so a "matching digest" built from it would be a rule that always fails.

What this file holds is the part that would rot silently: the live blocks are built from a parsed
`LiveConfig` in the engine while the startup gate builds them from the raw profile mapping in
`beidou_live.config`, and two functions producing "the same" dict is exactly how a comparison starts
passing for the wrong reason.
