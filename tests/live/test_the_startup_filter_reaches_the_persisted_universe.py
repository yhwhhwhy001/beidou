"""The startup filter is a mutation of the managed set, so it has to reach disk like the other three.

`startup` drops symbols the venue will not trade (`engine.py`, right after `venue.rules()`), and every
OTHER mutation of `self.universe` pairs the in-process list with `self.state.universe`: `__init__` when
the profile pins a universe, `_quarantine` on D-031's exit, `_maybe_refresh_universe` on D-014's daily
refresh.  This one did not, and `store.save(self.state)` at the end of `startup` then persisted the
UNFILTERED list.

Why that matters rather than being untidy.  `beidou live verify` (M-011, D-023) reads only
`state.universe` - for the fetch list and for `reference_symbols`.  D-042 rules that the reference
population is an explicit contract, so a reproduction that ranks and demeans over a strictly larger
population than the cycle did moves EVERY cross-sectional contribution, not one symbol's.  M-011 goes
red with nothing in the record able to say why: that is KILL-027's shape one layer down.

It does not self-heal under the shipped profile: a pinned universe makes `_maybe_refresh_universe`
return before it touches `state.universe`, so only a restart with every pinned symbol tradable clears
it.  And `engine.py`'s own `logger.warning("dropping non-tradable symbols...")` exists because the
author expects the dropped list to be non-empty - a pinned symbol going SETTLING or BREAK.
