"""M-007's denominator (2026-09-19): `margin_cap` was calibrated where collateral does not exist.

The backtest models no collateral (RISK-G11), so `margin_cap: 0.40` was always a statement about the
USDT line.  Measuring it against total equity - about half BTC here - made the ruler 1.9x looser than
the policy it stands for, and M-007 had never once reported a breach.

This is the same correction as 2026-09-14, one layer down: that one fixed the BAR (the plan's 50%
judging where the profile said 40%), this one fixes the DENOMINATOR.
