"""2026-09-09: the traded population is a decision, so it lives in the registry and moves by transaction.

Before this, `universe.json` was the decision and the loop rewrote it every day at about 01:00Z.  Every
cited report records the universe fingerprint it was produced under, so each daily re-rank made the
evidence stop describing the traded population and `registry_dataset_problems` refused the next armed
start.  Measured: restartability expired daily, and nothing anywhere said so until a canary triggered
it seven hours early on 2026-09-08.

So the re-rank keeps happening and keeps being recorded, and stops deciding - the same split the
governance plan applies to every other construction change, applied to the population.  What a batch
window acts on is the recorded proposal.

    fingerprint over: adding the KEY unconditionally moves the digest of every registry that pins

    shipped file made an intentional `governance apply` fail a unit test, which teaches whoever hits it
    to update the constant reflexively - the exact reflex a frozen hash exists to prevent.  Whether the
