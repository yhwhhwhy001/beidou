"""§5 states L3's criterion twice and the two disagree; nothing computed either until 2026-09-09.

The L3 row says "7 天无 ERROR 相".  Two paragraphs later the same section says the path to the venue
crosses a proxy that returns 503 in bursts and that an ERROR phase produces no governance decision -
which KILL-AR-20 turned into `Policy.no_decision_phases`.  One counts ERROR cycles; the other is a
claim about their consequences, and on the armed record the second holds while the first cannot:
0.318 ERROR/day over 6.29 days, longest clean run 4.92 days, and a Poisson fit puts seven consecutive
clean days at 10.8%.

So this module reports both and rules on neither.  The ruling is the operator's; a scorer that quietly
picked one would be making it.
