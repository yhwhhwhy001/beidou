"""D-045: the traps that produced four different answers to one question, each pinned by a test.

Every case here is a mistake this repository actually made on 2026-09-19 while answering "is the live
book's return the market's or the signal's", not a hypothetical.  The numbers in the assertions are
the shapes of those mistakes, so a regression reads as the wrong answer coming back.

2026-09-22 added a fifth, found while re-checking the same question three days later: `NW_LAGS` and
`MIN_BARS` were both 48, so a window that just cleared the minimum ran a Bartlett kernel as wide as
its own sample.  A 55-bar window read alpha t = **5.49** that way, against 2.23 on plain OLS - the
correction shrank the standard error threefold instead of widening it, and 5.49 would have read as
"the signal finally shows".  See `MAX_LAG_SHARE` for where the boundary was measured.
