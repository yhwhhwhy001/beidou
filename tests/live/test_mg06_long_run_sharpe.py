"""M-G06: the lagging half of §19 Q2's "持续盈利" ruling, which until now was zero code.

The 2026-09-08 governance plan resolved Q2 into two criteria and shipped one.  M-010 - the leading half,
"没炸", live Sharpe not worse than the backtest's q10 - has existed since 2026-09-07.  M-G06 is the
lagging half: per strategy, on attributed P&L in M-010's own units, the annualised Sharpe over a window
in which `canonical_construction` has not changed for 18 months, point estimate >= 0, Newey-West t
REPORTED and not a gate (the same disposition D-P2 gave t), failure action "该策略退出 main".

Every clause of that is a decision already taken, so none of it is chosen here.  What this module must
not do is soften any of them to produce a number today, and the shape it has to get right is the one it
will hold for the next year and a half: **the answer today is INSUFFICIENT_DATA, and that is the correct
answer, not a gap**.  The current construction started 2026-09-04T14:00Z and 18 months from there is
2028-03-04.  A criterion whose window is 18 months and whose record is five days does not get to say
anything about the strategy, and a verdict computed on five days would be the exact failure this metric
exists to prevent - at five days the annualised-Sharpe standard error is about 8.5, so the point
estimate is compatible with nearly any truth.  What it CAN say, and does, is how much longer.

Elapsed time is counted in BARS UNDER THE CONSTRUCTION rather than off a wall clock, which is M-010's
own reading ("M-010 5.00/30 天") and the only one that cannot be satisfied by a loop that was down.
