    """Share of a symbol's income owned by each strategy: w_k T_k / sum_j w_j T_j.  Signed (D-044).

    The denominator is the NET exposure and the numerator keeps its sign, so a strategy that is short
    a symbol the book made money on is charged a negative share.  The shares still sum to 1, so
    ``sum_k share_k * income`` is the income; what changes is that a share may be negative or above 1.

    What this replaces and why.  E-050 hit a signed denominator going to zero and fixed it by taking
    magnitudes - which bounds every share to [0, 1] and, in doing so, makes each strategy's attributed
    P&L carry the sign of the SYMBOL's P&L rather than the sign of its own exposure.  Inside one
    symbol every strategy is then paid or charged together, whatever side it is on.  That is not a
    corner case here: measured 2026-09-17 on the running loop, flow and tsmom overlapped on three
    symbols (ENA, LINK, TRUMP) and disagreed on all three - flow short about -0.07 of equity against
    tsmom long 1.0 - so on 100 USDT of income the magnitude split paid flow about +6.5 where its own
    exposure earns about -7.4.  The registry's "91% of its positions stack on tsmom's shorts" is a
    backtest-period statistic and was 0% agreement on the day this was measured.

    It matters because of what reads the number.  `beidou_live.probe` sums `by_strategy` over 30 days
    and closes a probe book at -2% of equity; that stop is the ONLY automatic control on the flow
    sleeve, which runs against a book-level REJECT by the operator's D-029 exception.  A sign error
    in the sleeve's own P&L is a sign error in its brake.

    E-050's failure is answered by refusing rather than by rewriting: when the legs cancel to within
    ``MIN_NET_SHARE`` of their gross, the symbol has no attributable owner and this returns ``{}``,
    which ``attribute`` already books as ``unattributed``.  An un-owned bar is a true statement; a
    bounded-but-wrong-signed one is not.

    The case this exists for: on 2026-09-04 the operator flattened the whole book by hand and its +26.30
    realised P&L was attributed to tsmom.  That is right in economic terms - tsmom chose and held those
    positions - but it compressed a whole holding period's unrealised P&L into one bar, and M-010 reads a
    per-bar income series, so mean and variance both move.  Splitting keeps the operator's P&L in the
