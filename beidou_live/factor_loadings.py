"""What the live book loaded on besides the market: BTC, size, low volatility, funding (#6.4 / #6.9).

D-045 (`benchmark.py`) asks one question with one regressor - how much of the book's return was the
market's - and on 2026-09-19 its answer was all of it (RESEARCH_LOG, "F4 的结构命题第一次有了测量").
Checklist items 6.4 and 6.9 of `docs/analysis/2026-09-23-external-prompt-checklist-vs-beidou.md`
asked the next question and found nobody computing it.  This module reads it under D-045's four
rules rather than beside them:

1. **Point in time.**  Every factor is built over the universe the loop held at that bar (the cycle
   record's `universe`), never over a panel's symbols.  A point-in-time panel carries every name that
   was EVER a member, and the names chosen later carried an equal-weight Sharpe of +2.32 over the bars
   before they were chosen (RESEARCH_LOG 2026-09-23, the GAP-SF02 section's `bb1b9262` note).  A sort
   key at bar t reads only klines that closed by t's close and funding settled before it, and the
   return it is paid is t -> t+1.  The sort is taken over bar t's universe alone: a sort that also
   asked who was still a member at t+1 would rank with a piece of t+1.
2. **Newey-West**, through `benchmark.nw_covariance`: D-045's estimator and its bandwidth clamp.
3. **Exposure-conditioned.**  Each factor is multiplied by the exposure the loop carried into the bar:
   net for the market and BTC, as D-045 does, gross for the three long-short sorts.  That is a
   simplification, stated rather than hidden.  One number per bar stands in for how the weights sat
   across the terciles, so the loading assumes the book's shape held while its size moved.  The
   unconditioned regression is reported beside it, as D-045 reports both.
4. **No alpha over bars where the signal made no distinction.**  A bar whose record holds no short
   (`signal_state`'s all-long test, which also covers a bar with no contributions at all) gets an
   intercept of its own, and only the other bars' intercept is reported as alpha.

The factors, each a log return so that the market one is D-045's regressor exactly:

    market    the point-in-time equal-weight basket: `pit_benchmark` on `window_prices`
    btc       BTCUSDT
    size      top third by trailing 30-day quote volume minus the bottom third - big minus small,
              the opposite sign of the textbook SMB
    low_vol   bottom third by trailing 30-day realised volatility minus the top third
    funding   top third by trailing 7-day summed funding rate minus the bottom third

Funding is SUMMED over the week because intervals differ: on 2026-09-24 LSKUSDT settled 168 times in
seven days, HYPEUSDT 42 and BTCUSDT 21, so a mean per settlement would rank a price of carry by how
often it is charged.  The legs are equal-weight and their returns are price returns.  The funding the
legs would have paid is not in them, while the book's USDT line pays its own, so the book's funding
lands in the residual.

The archive is synced once a day (`deploy/com.beidou.data.plist`, 17:20Z) while the loop runs every
hour.  At 17:20Z the archive ends at the 16:00Z bar, and by 17:00Z the next day the loop is 24 bars past
it.  A key at a bar after the archive's last reads a window short of its newest klines and settlements,
so it is provisional: the next sync fills the window in and can move the legs.  `archive` says where the
archive stopped and how many bars short of the sample's end, and both readers print it.

`factor_reading` is pure.  `archive_history` and `archive_funding` are the archive adapters its two
callers share, so the daily block and `report beta` cannot read the archive two ways.  Nothing here
writes, gates or pages.
