"""One trading process per account (DL-L1 / KILL-Q7).

``execute_order`` queries before it submits, which stops a *serial* repeat - the same bar replayed
after a restart.  It does nothing about two processes woken by the same scheduler at close+5s, and
that is the real shape of the risk here: seven worktrees on one machine, credentials sourced
globally from ``~/.zshrc``, ``state_dir`` and the kill switch on relative paths, and ``live run``
defaulting to non-dry-run.  A second loop started in any worktree trades the same account with its
own state, its own invisible kill switch, and a universe fallen back to ``always_include``.

The lock is therefore keyed to the **account**, not to a directory: a truncated SHA-256 of the API
key under an absolute application-support path, so every worktree contends for the same file.  It
holds ``flock(LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)`` for the life of the process; the kernel releases it if the holder
dies, so a crash never locks the operator out - which a pid file would.
