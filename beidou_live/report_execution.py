    DL-L4 wrote both facts into every cycle row - how late the wake-up was relative to the bar close,
    and whether that lateness cost a rebalance - and nothing read them.  The plan assumed every
    deployment restart costs late fills and 7bps of gross; this is the number that would show whether
    the assumption is generous or mean.

    The thresholds are M-Q03's own, from the 2026-09-06 remediation plan ("<= 5% / 0", baseline
    "稳态 0/8"), transcribed into ``risk_budget`` in the profile so they have a reader.  Until
    2026-09-09 they were compared to nothing: the four numbers below were rendered and left there.

    Two things a reader should not have to discover.  First, ``missed_rebalances``, ``skipped_bars`` and
    ``late_bars`` are the SAME rows today, not three facts that happen to agree: the engine writes
    ``late_seconds`` into a cycle row only in ``_record_missed_rebalance``, which also sets the phase and
    the reason.  They are kept apart because they are different questions and a future engine could
    separate them, but nobody should read agreement between them as corroboration.

    Second, this counts miss ROWS and no longer reconstructs the engine's running total.  That counter
    is reset by every restart, so three consecutive processes that each missed once write 1, 1, 1 and a
    drop-detector reports one miss - which is exactly what happened on 2026-09-09, where the record
    holds three miss rows.  It was also wrong the other way, charging a process that spanned midnight
    with yesterday's misses.  Every miss appends exactly one row, so the rows are the count.

    The FILL half is reported and deliberately not judged.  M-Q03 is named for late fills, the fills
    carry their own ``late_seconds``, and the worst one ever written is 26.3s against the 72-98s
    rebalance windows the engine actually used - so this half has never been the binding one, and
    picking a seconds bar for it would be the invented number KILL-R6 refuted.  The plan's preferred
    bar-hour weighting is not computable either: nothing records how long a late-entered position was
    held.  KILL-R6 named the per-cycle share as the acceptable reading and that is what is judged.

    """#10.9 / #10.10: each fill's pre-trade cost estimate beside what it cost.  Reported, never judged.

    **Pre-trade, rebuilt offline.**  The loop records no estimate, and recording one would cost a
    restart for a reading.  Everything the estimate needs is already on the trade row or in the archive,
    so rebuilding it here gives the number the loop would have written.  It is the cost model: taker
    fee, `slippage_bps`, and the square-root impact term the way `backtest.impact_costs` prices it -
    coefficient x sigma_daily x sqrt(notional / ADV) over the trailing `vol_window_bars` and
    `adv_window_bars` - on the PLANNED notional (`quantity` x `price`, both fixed before the order was
    sent).  Participation is that notional over the decision bar's quote volume.  Every input is the
    decision bar or older: it had closed when the order went out, and it is the last bar
    `impact_costs` reads for the execution bar.  The coefficient is E5 and has never been calibrated
    (demo fills are too small to measure it, `config/costs.yaml`), so the error below measures the
    model, not execution.

    **Post-trade, against `decision_close`**, signed so a cost is positive, over M-Q08's population
    (its window, no flattens, a reference on the row) with its arithmetic (`_weighted`: notional-
    weighted, Kish SE) and its split by book (`fill_grouper`) - which is what lets the mean reconcile
    to both of M-Q08's readings, the whole book and the main book it judges, and the block checks that
    it does.  Split at the next bar's archived open into the gap (decision close -> open) and the fill
    (open -> average price), both in bps of the decision close so the two add up.  The fill part
    carries the order's delay past the open, the spread and any impact; 1h bars cannot tell those
    three apart.

    **The spread is not split out, for two reasons checked 2026-09-24.**  The fills trade on the demo
    book, and it is not mainnet's: from 19:14 to 19:15Z demo BTCUSDT held its best bid / ask at
    84457.9 / 84462.5 while mainnet's moved between 84580 and 84545, three demo AKEUSDT ask levels
    each held 6,537,999, and demo's hourly quote volume on BTCUSDT ran 6-22x mainnet's on the four
    bars sampled.  And the one archived top of book, data.binance.vision's `bookTicker`, stops in
    2024-04 (BTCUSDT daily 2023-05-16 to 2024-03-30; none at all for AKEUSDT or ENAUSDT).  `bookDepth`
    runs to date, but it is mainnet's book.

    **The fee is listed apart**, as booked: the commission over the fill's notional.  An attribution
    row carries `state.last_bar_ms` - the bar of the cycle BEFORE the one that read the income, which
    is the cycle that placed the fills the commission came from - so (bar, symbol) keys a fill to its
    commission, and only a key with one row on each side is read.  On 2026-09-24 that booked 4.0 bps
    on thirteen names and 5.0 on seven, against the model's flat 5.0.

    The catch is broad for `execution_fidelity`'s reason: this runs in the hourly check and judges
    nothing, so it must not take the report or its alerts down.  The block carries the reason instead.
