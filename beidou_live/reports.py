"""The daily, weekly and beta reports: assembly only.

Until 2026-09-25 this one file held every reading the monitoring layer takes: 3,175 lines, and the
file where parallel sessions' daily-report changes collided (the 2026-09-23 batch resolved its
conflicts here and in the source budget table).  The readings now live by the checklist area they
answer in `docs/analysis/2026-09-23-external-prompt-checklist-vs-beidou.md`:

    report_decay       #1.10 edge decay, #4.10 signal monitoring, the automatic part of D.3
    report_risk        #3 the daily risk dashboard
    report_exits       #1.5 / #3.2 the exit overlay
    report_execution   #10 execution (M-Q08 itself is execution_fidelity.py)
    report_data        #9 data (bar sanity is bar_sanity.py)
    report_beta        #6.9 attribution: market beta (D-045)
    report_governance  the weekly's effort share and pre-registration order
    report_common      what all of them read the state files with

What stays here is the assembly - `daily_payload`, `daily_alerts`, `daily_markdown`,
`weekly_payload`, `weekly_markdown` - and every name a caller already imports from this address,
re-exported as the same object.  A new reading goes in its area's module, not here:
`tests/live/test_the_report_layer_kept_its_addresses.py` fails if a definition other than the
assembly lands in this file.

Only that address contract is re-exported.  A library name kept here for convenience would let a
monkeypatch aimed at this module silently miss the reading that now calls it from another one -
the one failure this kind of split does not announce (M6, 2026-09-17).  `window_sharpes` is the one
name here that was never defined in this file; `tests/live/test_decay_detector.py` imports it from
this address, so it stays.
