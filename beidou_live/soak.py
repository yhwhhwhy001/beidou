"""L3's criterion, computed - and computed twice, because §5 states it two ways that disagree.

Nothing read `.beidou/paper-l3` until 2026-09-09.  The soak ran, launchd kept it alive, and the
criterion it was running against lived only in prose.

**The two readings.**  §5's L3 row says "7 天无 ERROR 相".  The Testnet paragraph of the same section
says "到币安的路径经系统代理 1082，间歇 503——ERROR 相**不产生任何治理决定**", and KILL-AR-20 turned
that into `Policy.no_decision_phases`.  Those are not two wordings of one rule.  The first counts
ERROR cycles; the second says an ERROR cycle is a cycle that decided nothing, which is a statement
about consequences.  Measured on the armed record 2026-09-09: 2 ERROR cycles in 6.29 days, rate
0.318/day, longest clean run 4.92 days, and **both ERROR cycles produced zero governance side effect**
- no orders, nothing leaving, nothing quarantined, the ladder untouched, no universe update.

Under a Poisson fit that rate gives a 10.8% chance of seven consecutive clean days, 1.2% of fourteen,
0.03% of thirty.  So the literal reading is not a demanding criterion, it is a mostly unreachable one,
and it is unreachable for a reason §5 itself names two paragraphs later.  This module reports both and
rules on neither: `literal_pass` and `no_decision_pass`, side by side, with the counts under each.

A third number is reported because neither reading covers it: the longest ERROR STREAK.  One 503 is
the proxy blinking; six hours of them is the venue being unreachable, and only the second is a fact
about whether this deployment works.

**Ruled 2026-09-10.**  The gate is the no-decision reading AND a bar on that streak; the literal count
stays computed and printed and gates nothing.

Why the no-decision reading, stated so it is not mistaken for picking the criterion that passes: only
one of the two sentences has a mechanism behind it.  `no_decision_phases` exists, is enforced, and is
falsifiable per cycle - an ERROR cycle that placed an order, quarantined a sleeve or moved the ladder
fails it and the row says so.  The literal count has no mechanism; it tallies a phase whose meaning is
"the loop declined to act on bad data", which is the loop working.  The contradiction in §5 predates
every measurement here.

And the criterion is made HARDER where it was blind.  Six hours of 503s decide nothing either, so the
no-decision reading alone cannot see an outage.  The streak bar is `STUCK_IN_ERROR_STREAK` - the same
3 that `live status --check` already pages on - rather than a number chosen here: a week that held an
incident the hourly check was alerting about is not a week that proved unattended operation.
