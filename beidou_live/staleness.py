"""When a symbol stops being tradable - all five rules, in one place, with which side each binds on.

There is no single rule.  There are five, they live in three packages, they carry three different
numbers, and two of them bind on only one side of the system:

    rule                     where                                   number              binds
    ------------------------ --------------------------------------- ------------------- --------------
    carry through gaps       beidou_alpha/overlays/exits.py          stale_carry_bars=2  research only
    skip the symbol          beidou_live/exits.py  (ExitOverlay)     unbounded           live
    hold, then flatten       beidou_live/engine.py (_hold_dropped)   dropped_after=1     live only
    skip the whole cycle     beidou_live/guards.py                   stale_bars_max=2    live only
    leave the pool           beidou_live/engine.py (_quarantine)     quarantine_after=3  live only

That spread is the finding.  On a bar a symbol cannot be priced on, research carries the position for
two bars with the stop live, and live zeroes the target - the model does not score an unpriced symbol,
`raw.setdefault(symbol, 0.0)` makes that a flat target, and the position is closed and re-opened next
cycle with the trailing anchor gone.  Two books.

**Why this module declares the rules instead of merging them.**

`beidou_alpha/overlays/exits.py` says, of `stale_carry_bars`: *"Research and live disagreeing about
when a symbol stops being tradable is KILL-027's shape, so this reuses the loop's number rather than
inventing a second one"* - and then, two lines later, that it binds in research only.  The intent was
right and the code did not keep it.  The repair is not to quietly make it bind: `dropped_after` is the
live half of the same question and `construction.py` records the operator's ruling on it in as many
words - it *"shipped at 3, which is a different book.  It ships at 1 instead ... raising it stays a
priced decision rather than a side effect of deploying a fix."*

So the values stay exactly where the operator put them, and what changes is that the disagreement is
now written down as data with a test behind it, rather than as prose that has already gone stale once:
the same comment still said `stale_carry_bars` was "not yet in `construction_fingerprint`" after v6
put it there.

**What the divergence costs today: nothing, and that is measured, not assumed.**  Over the 322 live
cycles on record, `inputs.dropped` is non-empty in 0 of them and `dropped_inputs` names a symbol in 0
of them.  The five PIT members of the 1h archive that carry internal gaps (1,005 symbol-bars) are none
of them in the pinned live universe, which is why the research side binds and the live side never has.
The divergence is latent, not active - which is the reason to price the flip rather than ship it.

**One correction to this table, 2026-09-17.**  `skip the whole cycle` was listed as binding on both
sides.  It does not and never has: `_replay_book_guards` carries no staleness branch, and D-036's
shared definition is `BookGuardParams`, which holds the caps and the daily-loss pause and not this.
The entry was wrong rather than the code - a backtest has no bar that arrived late - so the row now
reads `live only`, and `test_a_rule_that_claims_a_research_half_has_one` checks the claim against the
alpha-side parameter objects instead of only checking that the word is spelled correctly.  Worth its
own paragraph: a table written so that a wrong entry could be argued with carried a wrong entry for
as long as nothing read it back.
