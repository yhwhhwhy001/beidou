"""M-Q08 execution fidelity: the instrument its turnover clause never had, and slippage read week by week.

M-Q08 is one of the two criteria the demo phase is judged by (the learning-plan table of
`docs/analysis/2026-09-06-remediation-execution-plan.md`): turnover within ±25% of the backtest over the
same period, slippage at most twice the model, late cycles at most 5%, the registry digest consistent.
Slippage (`risk_budget.slippage_bps`) and lateness (`reports.restart_cost`) had readings, the digest is on
every cycle row; turnover had no instrument at all (G9 of
`docs/analysis/2026-09-23-external-prompt-checklist-vs-beidou.md`), and nothing read slippage over time.

**One unit on both sides: notional traded over the equity it was sized from, keyed by the deciding bar.**
The backtest's turnover is `sum |Δw|` per bar, a weight being a fraction of the equity at the decision.
Live, `target_notional` is `target_weight` times the equity the cycle recorded - on all 202 trade rows with
a nonzero target and a priced cycle, 2026-09-23, to 1.8e-12 U - so a fill's notional over its own cycle's
equity is that symbol's `|Δw|`.  The backtest charges the weight decided on bar t at bar t+1, so its series
is moved back one bar the way `run_backtest` finds `decision_times`; a live fill carries the `bar_open_ms`
of the cycle that decided it.  What the unit does NOT make equal is what M-Q08 exists to see: the
backtest's held position is last bar's target, so drift is free, while live the band is judged against the
venue's drifted position; missed bars, the participation cap, the venue minimum and the exit anchors the
loop has carried since it first built the book are all execution.

**Same period, same construction.**  The backtest side is the model the registry on disk builds, priced by
`score_book` with the profile's guards and exits (`live_overlay_blocks`, what the startup gate compares),
over the newest run of cycles on one construction AND one registry digest, at most `WINDOW_DAYS`, and only
while the disk digest is the loop's.  Its universe is the one the loop recorded bar by bar, so the pool is
held equal; bars before the loop recorded any use the point-in-time table, as research's backtest does.

**Path dependence, measured on the 2026-09-23 record.**  The exit overlay anchors on the entry price and the
band on the previous position, so the replay's state at the window's first bar depends on where it starts.
Starting 1,442 bars before the window (what the loop requests) gave ratio 1.40; 30 days earlier, 2.0679;
60, 120 and 180 days earlier agreed with that to 1e-5.  Hence `WARMUP_DAYS`.  From the other side, the
loop's anchors date from when IT built the book: in that window it took ten take-profits and the replay
four, the same four among them, and the six only the loop took were all anchored at the 2026-09-13T20:00Z
closes - the bar that rebuilt the book after that evening's flatten.  Each costs an exit and a re-entry.

**Cells the archive cannot price.**  The data job syncs the current candidates, so a name the loop still
holds can stop updating: LSKUSDT's archive ends 2026-09-18T16:00Z while the loop held it on 09-23.  A
symbol-bar past its last archived close leaves BOTH sides, and what that took off the live side is printed.
