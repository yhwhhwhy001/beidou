"""D-026: when the construction fingerprint's DEFINITION changes, and what that must not reset.

`construction_fingerprint` answers "is this the same book?".  Two things here keep that answer honest
across changes to the question: a version for the field set being hashed, reported outside the hash so
bumping it cannot move the digest it explains, and the aliases an operator has declared to mean the
same book.

Split out of ``health.py`` in 2026-09-15.  The table lived there for one reason - `engine.py` would
have imported it circularly - which is a module chosen by an import graph rather than by a concept, and
it is why answering "did the construction change?" meant bouncing between five modules.  A module of
its own has no cycle to dodge: nothing here imports the engine.
"""

from __future__ import annotations

# The field set `construction_fingerprint` hashes.  Bumped whenever a key is added or removed, and
# reported OUTSIDE the hash so that bumping it does not itself move the digest - inside, the version
# would change the very number it exists to explain.
#   1: the original 22 fields
#   2: + `exits.unit_mode` (P22).  The field is right - it decides what the exit overlay does, and
#      KILL-R14's 7-of-18 unplaceable stops are that setting - but adding it moved the digest while the
#      book was byte-identical, and `evidence_window` read that as a construction change.
#   3: + the four `exits.regime_*` (P23), the same day and the same way.  Inert at the shipped config:
#      `regime_window` defaults to 0 and `regime_tp_scale()` returns None at <= 0, and the profile sets
#      none of the four - so again the values are unchanged and only the shape moved.  Twice in one day
#      is why `test_construction_identity` now pins the field set: the next one fails a test instead.
#   8: + `exits.trailing_activate` (EXP-AE3, 2026-09-17).  The activation threshold the operator's
#      "移动止盈" needs and the repository did not have: `trailing_stop` alone measures the retracement
#      from an `extreme` initialised to the ENTRY price, so it fires while a position is still losing.
#      Ships at 0.0, which arms from entry - today's behaviour exactly - and `_armed` returns True
#      before reading the excursion at all, so the two engines stay bit-identical and only the shape of
#      what is hashed moved.
#   4: + `portfolio.min_history_bars` (2026-09-09).  Inert at the shipped config for the same reason
#      the two above were: the value is 720 before and after, and only the shape of what is hashed
#      moved.  It belongs in the digest because `AlphaModel.eligible` uses it to decide WHICH SYMBOLS
#      may be held at all, so changing it changes the book - found while asking whether the
#      new-listing strategy (#27) could be implemented, which it cannot without lowering this.

# changed, only the shape of what was hashed.  Operator ruled the pre-15:00Z rows are the same

    # close is missing before `exit_step` is reached, so the live construction is unchanged whatever
    # the value reads.  `dropped_after` is the third, and it is the one that had to be MADE true: the
    # rule it names - hold a symbol whose bars did not arrive, rather than flattening and re-opening
    # it next cycle - shipped at 3, which is a different book.  It ships at 1 instead, which is the
    # behaviour it was written to make visible, so the proof reads the same way as the other two and
    # raising it stays a priced decision rather than a side effect of deploying a fix.  Without the
