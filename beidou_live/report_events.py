"""#8.10 event risk: the stablecoin peg, the loop's incidents on its path to the venue, and extreme moves.

Checklist item 8.10 of `docs/analysis/2026-09-23-external-prompt-checklist-vs-beidou.md` asks for a geopolitical
risk framework.  In a USDⓈ-M book its counterparts are a venue incident, a regulatory action and a stablecoin
leaving its peg.  The 2026-09-23 inventory found reactions (D-031's quarantine, the loop's breaker) and no
reading.  These are the readings.  A rule that trades on them is a construction change: its draft
pre-registration is `docs/analysis/2026-09-25-event-risk-rule-prereg-draft.md`, and nothing here acts.

Reported, never alerted.  No threshold was registered before these went live, and one picked after reading the
number is not a threshold, so `daily_alerts` never reads this block.  Three readings, each behind its own catch:
one that cannot be read costs its own block, not the report.

  stablecoin  Binance spot USDC/USDT, off the archive (`stablecoin_peg`)
  venue       what the loop recorded going wrong on its path to the exchange (`venue_incidents`); no network
  market      BTCUSDT and an equal-weight basket of the managed universe, the newest hourly moves in units of
              their own volatility (`market_extremes`)

Two of the three read the archive, and the archive is not the loop's feed.  `deploy/com.beidou.data.plist` syncs
it once a day at 01:20 host time (17:20Z on this +08:00 host) and keeps closed bars only, so its newest bar is
that day's 16:00Z.  In the hourly check it runs 1 to 24 bars behind the decision bar - the sawtooth
`holdings_correlation` documents.  These windows end at the archive's newest bar rather than at the decision bar,
so they never read short, and `lag_bars` says how far behind that bar is.
