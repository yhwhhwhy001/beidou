"""P13's pre-registered monitoring: is the book still inside the risk budget it was sized for?

`vol_target` was set to 0.30 against a declared 50% drawdown budget, from a bootstrap whose q95 sits at
-43.7%/-49.5%.  That bootstrap resamples weekly blocks, so it preserves within-week autocorrelation and
destroys the multi-month regime structure real bear markets have — it is optimistic by construction, and
the de-escalation ladder below is what covers the gap.  The thresholds were written before the change
went live and are not up for renegotiation when they fire; what is deliberately NOT automated is the
acting, because rewriting live position sizing from a cron job is a different risk than measuring it.

Every metric here refuses to read zero when it cannot be computed (the failure this project keeps
finding): a window with too few bars, or one straddling a construction change, reports `enforced: false`
with the reason rather than a number that looks like a pass.

    the venue's own margin basis, and under cross margin the collateral really does absorb losses.  That
    ruling makes a pro-cyclical amplifier a NAMED accepted risk rather than an oversight - every weight
    is a fraction of an equity that is 52% non-USDT, so collateral up 10% is every target notional up
    5.2%, and the backtest models no collateral at all.

    An accepted risk with no instrument is a sentence, which is the failure this repository keeps
    finding, so this is the instrument.  It measures and changes nothing.

    The reading is NOT a stable level, and saying so is the point of `direction` below.  Over the first
    23 cycles that recorded a collateral reading (2026-09-07T15:00Z onward) it was 73% - equity -60.11

    the 47 cycles available on 2026-09-09 the same instrument reads 106.8%: equity +36.41 while the book
    was DOWN 2.48.  Both readings are correct and they are not the same kind of statement, so what is
    reported beside the number is which SIDE of 1.0 it sits on, which is a fact about signs rather than
    a level: above 1 the account's equity direction no longer tells you the book's P&L direction.

    ``drawdown_state`` above reads venue equity, which is the operator's capital and therefore the

    book is losing money: 52% of this account is non-USDT collateral and, measured over the 23 cycles
    that carried a collateral reading, 73% of the equity change was repricing rather than trading
    (KILL-AR-05).  Read that 73% as one window's reading and not as a property - on 2026-09-09 the same
    instrument reports 106.8% over 47 cycles, i.e. the equity line was rising while the book lost money,
    which strengthens this argument rather than weakening it.  A -35% equity drawdown can be bitcoin, and
    de-risking a book that never lost anything is a real cost paid for a reading that was never about
    the book.

    So the path here is ``base + cumsum(attributed P&L)``: it starts at the account's equity and moves

    arrives as a TRANSFER and carrying a pre-reset peak forward reports a drawdown nobody suffered.

    2026-09-12 ALERT is why: 5.47 bps against a 4 bps bar, which is neither book's number.  The
    fourteen names only the main book holds filled at **0.80 bps**; the four the flow probe adds
    filled at **16.18** (t = 2.31 against the bar, the only one of the three readings that clears
    its own error bar).  An aggregate over two populations describes neither, and this one was about
    to fail a demo-phase success criterion on behalf of a 1/3-fraction probe book.

    The gate is NOT moved here - `inside` still reads the combined number, because which book M-Q08
    judges is an operator's ruling and a criterion that re-points itself when it fires is the shape
    R10 forbids.  What changes is that the split and the error bar are on the page when that ruling
    is made.

    The reference is the decision bar's close because that is what the backtest enters at: weights
    decided on bar t are executed over bar t+1 at its open (`decided.shift(1)` with `open_to_close`),
    and in a continuous market that open is bar t's close.  The venue mark this used to read is an
    index price sampled when the cycle woke; comparing to it answers a question M-Q08 did not ask.
