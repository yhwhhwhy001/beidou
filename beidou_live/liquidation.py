"""DL-X1 / M-Q06: how close the book is to a liquidation, in units it can be judged in.

Distance is reported in DAILY VOLATILITY units rather than percent, because a percentage says nothing
about whether a name can travel that far.  Split out of ``health.py`` in 2026-09-15: that module was
four unrelated concepts behind a name that predicted none of them, and this is the one its own
``__all__`` did not mention.

Reports only.  Like everything in `risk_budget`'s block it alerts and never trades, and a distance it
cannot compute comes back as ``None`` with a reason rather than as a number that looks safe.
