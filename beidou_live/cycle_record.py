"""What a row of `cycles.jsonl` contains, declared in one place.

The cycle record is the widest interface in this package and it had no declaration anywhere.  About
forty-two keys, written by three methods of `LiveEngine` - the literal in `run_cycle`, four more added
after execution, five more in `_finish_cycle`, two conditional - and read by six modules
(`reports`, `risk_budget`, `verify`, `health`, `probe`, `soak`) under 192 distinct `.get("…")` names.

**This is deliberately not a typed row, and that is not laziness.**  `cycles.jsonl` is an append-only
ledger years deep: a field's absence in an old row means "written before this field existed", and every
reader's `.get()` plus `isinstance` check is the correct handling for that.  A dataclass with required
fields would refuse to read the history the file exists to keep.

What was missing is not types.  It is a place where the writer and the reader can be compared, because
the failures this record produces are always the same shape - one writer and one reader disagreeing
about a key - and there was nowhere for that disagreement to show up:

* `startup` filtered the universe and did not write it back, so `verify` ranked over a different
  population than the cycle scored.
* the ERROR path wrote none of L3's five decision keys, so `soak`'s gate could not fail.
* `_decided` tested `risk_ladder` for emptiness while `_risk_ladder` never returns `{}`.

All three are one key, one writer, one reader.  `KEYS` below is the declaration, and
`tests/live/test_the_cycle_record_is_declared.py` compares it against what the engine actually writes,
in both directions.

    Deliberately narrow.  The review this module came out of counted seven "scan backwards until
    something carries X" loops and called them near-identical; reading them, they are not.
    `verify.last_cycle`, `last_scored_cycle` and `last_recorded_as_of_ms` each carry a DIFFERENT
    predicate, and `last_scored_cycle` spends a paragraph on why it cannot be `last_cycle` - a restart
    writes a SKIPPED row with no contributions, and reading the lag off that one measures a different
    event.  Collapsing those into a general helper would delete the explanation, which is the opposite
    of concentrating anything.  `reports.evidence_window`'s loop is not a lookup at all: it walks back
    while the construction still matches, to find where the current run began.

    What IS duplicated is this one question, asked in two modules: the newest row that carries a field.
    Two callers, so the seam is real; a third predicate belongs in its own named function with its own
    reason, the way `verify`'s three are.
