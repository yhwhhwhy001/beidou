    Seven members used to be missing from this file entirely and two more (``venue_time_ms``,
    ``user_trades``) were declared REQUIRED on :class:`Venue` while every call site probed them and
    fell back.  The port was wrong in both directions at once, and the lesson is already written two
    protocols down: *a protocol that omits what the caller actually reads has stopped describing the
    contract*.

    They are genuinely optional - the paper venue has no leverage brackets, the fake market feed has no
    REST client - so they live here rather than on :class:`Venue`, and the engine still probes.  What
    changes is that the probe now has something to check itself against: an adapter that means to
    supply one of these can be type-checked against this protocol, and
    ``tests/live/test_the_ports_describe_what_the_engine_reads.py`` fails if a call site starts reading
    a tenth member that nobody declared.

    The one to be careful with is ``venue_time_ms``.  D-030 is the hour of attribution that went to the
    wrong cycle because the income window was asked for on the host clock; the fallback when this is
    absent is that same host clock, which is why its absence is worth seeing in a type rather than
    discovering in a reconciliation.
