    """``state.json`` is there and cannot be parsed.  Refuse, do not start fresh.

    Until 2026-09-13 this case returned an empty ``LiveState()`` - no raise, no alert, no row - and
    four cross-cycle facts that exist in exactly one copy went with it: ``last_income_ms`` (the income
    watermark, whose loss sends `_ingest_income`'s window to ``[now, now]`` and drops every income row
    earned while the loop was down, permanently, out of ``attribution.jsonl``), ``equity_hwm`` (the
    drawdown reads 0 and D-015's throttle and R8's ladder both go blind at once), ``exit_states`` (every
    entry anchor is rebuilt from the venue's VWAP) and ``last_contributions`` (D-005's hold seed zeroes
    once).  KILL-006 rests M-010's 30-day window on that first one being continuous, and `decay_watch`
    reading a SHORTER `live_windows` cannot tell "the loop ran less" from "a chunk is missing".

    So the answer to a file that will not parse is to stop and say so.  The operator's way out is in
    the message: rename the bad file and let the next start rebuild, which is a DECISION with a record
    rather than a silent reset nobody sees.
