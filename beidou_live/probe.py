"""Probe books (D-019): a sleeve the operator runs as a bounded demo experiment with an automatic stop rule.

A probe book is enabled on a *book-level* ACCEPT (``beidou research book``) rather than a
signal-level PASS, so it exists to earn out-of-sample evidence, not because the evidence is in.
Two things bound it: ``stop`` closes the book automatically when its trailing attributed P&L
falls below ``-max_loss`` of equity, and ``review_after_days`` flags the review date in the
daily report.  Pure functions over attribution rows; the engine does the I/O.

    Realised income only moves when a position closes, and the no-trade band held 197 symbol-cycles on
    the day this was measured - a sleeve can bleed on the mark for a month while that series barely
    moves.  Neither number is the 2 sigma D-019 claimed, and they miss in opposite directions.

    A short window UNDER-states the loss, because it sums fewer bars.  For a stop that is the safe
    direction - it can only delay a stop, never cause one - so the reading is returned with its bar
    count rather than refused while it warms up.  `bars` is how a reader tells a quiet month from a

    Two calibers, and the gate is deliberately still on the OLD one.  2026-09-12, and the reason is
    the plan's own rule rather than a preference:

    * the sleeve's evidence is a mark-to-market P&L (30-day sigma **3.239%** of equity, recomputed over
      the validated panel); the stop reads realised attributed income (sigma **0.137%**).  So `-2%`
      sits at **14.6 sigma** of the series it reads and **0.62 sigma** of the series it was calibrated
      against - neither is the "-2 sigma" D-019 claimed, and they miss in opposite directions;
    * so caliber and threshold have to move TOGETHER.  Measured: moving the caliber alone would fire
      immediately - flow_short's marked 30-day reading is -3.197%, already past -2% (falsifier F3 of
      the 2026-09-12 pre-registration);
    * and `max_loss` is inside `construction_fingerprint` (`stop_of`), so changing it CLEARS M-010's
      30-day window - 7.96/30 today - and restarts M-G06's eighteen months.  §1 puts "changing the
      construction outside a window" out of scope and K-EX14 is the rule it serves.

    The pre-registered replacement is measured and waiting for the next batch window (2026-10-03):
    `max_loss` becomes the empirical 2.28% quantile of each book's own 30-day mark-to-market P&L -
    **7.5%** for flow_short and **11.2%** for main, against 2% and 6% today.  Those look looser and are
    not: today's rule cannot fire at all, and the new one fires at its stated 2.3% tail.

    Until then `marked` is computed and printed beside the gated number, which is what the same day's
    L3, M-015 and M-Q08 rulings did in the other direction: a reading that gates nothing is still a
    reading, and the day the two disagree is the day somebody needs to see both.
