    `ExitParams.min_unit`'s comment carries the derivation and the live table; the short form is that a
    long's price floor is zero, so `adverse <= 1/sigma` and a `stop_loss` at `k > 1/sigma` is arithmetic
    rather than protection.  The same bound lands on a short's `take_profit`, and on a long's trailing
    stop through `extreme`, which starts at the entry price and opens the ceiling up only as the
    position rallies.  A short's stop and a long's take-profit have unbounded numerators and are
    omitted rather than reported as safe, because "no ceiling" and "a ceiling nothing has crossed" are
    different facts and only the first is theirs.

    A reading, deliberately with no threshold and no alert.  A ceiling under the shipped `k` is not a
    fault: it is what inverse-vol sizing leaves behind on a symbol too loud to hold much of, and the
    position it describes is small for the same reason it is unreachable - one input, both effects.
    What it replaces is the way the first one was found, which was an operator reading a margin figure
    off a phone app.  Nothing here can be acted on inside the hour, so it must not page.
